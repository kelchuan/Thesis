\subsection{Overview of model behaviors}

\end{figure} 

Model results show systematic changes with the average M value ($\bar{M}$), which is the integration of M along the ridge divided by the ridge length. $\bar{M}$ values of all the models are listed in Table~\hyperref[Tab_3_3_average_M]{\ref{Tab_3_3_average_M}}. $\bar{M}_{M58} > \bar{M}_{M57} > \bar{M}_{M28}$ and within each M range, $\bar{M}$ with sqaure root functional form is higher than that with sinusoidal form, which in turn is higher than the linear form.

%Only the M58 models with Type 2 weakening exhibit the fault alternation. However, the model with the linear M profile (M58LinT2) is an exception, which shows only an inward fault jump until the end of the model time, 1.1 Myr. The behaviors of this group of models indicate that there is an lower limit in the average M values with which fault alternation occurs. According to the tabulated values of M averaged over the along-ridge distance in Table~\hyperref[Tab_3_3_average_M]{\ref{Tab_3_3_average_M}}, the lower limit is between 0.6425 of M58LinT2 and 0.6834 of M58SinT2. Detailed analysis of the fault alternation is given in ``Discussion''. , 

To facilitate the challenging task of describing the complicated behaviors of each model as well as comparing different models, I visualize the model behavior as shown in Fig.~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together}}. Each plot has the amount of extension in km as the horizontal axis and M values as the vertical axis. The plot can succinctly show what structure appears, how long it takes to be created or remains active, and where it is created along the ridge. 
For instance, from the plot for M57SinT1 ($\bar{M} =$ 0.6223) in Fig.~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together}}, one can see that an antithetic fault first shows up after about 17 km of extension on the low M end, a mass wasting event occurs after about 13 km of extension and the inward fault jump is absent in this model. Similarly, the plot for the M57SqrtT1 model ($\bar{M} =$ 0.6279) clearly shows that this model experiences two inward fault jumps. %and each of them produces a curved toward ridge axis termination. The curved termination is responsible for the following small scale mullion structure.

%The antithetic fault at the lower M side helps to maintain a closer to ridge axis termination which results in a larger mullion structure (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}.a}) at the lower M side and thus produces an OCC with a shape similar to the Atlantis Massif at 30 $\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 

Models with type 1 weakening, on the left column of Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together}}, show more complex and dynamic behaviors as $\bar{M}$ increases. In other words, more of the main structural characteristics are created and they tend to have a higher recurrence frequency as $\bar{M}$ increases. %when faulting (i.e. inward fault jump, antithetic fault) as well as other main model behaviors (i.e. corrugation, mullion, mass wasting, tensile failure) become more complex and dynamical with higher recurrence ferquencies.
%
For instance, %Comparing M28SinT1 and M28LinT1 shows that 
the inward fault jump occurs earlier and lasts a shorter period of time in M28SinT1 than in M28LinT1 due to a higher $\bar{M}$ of M28SinT1. Furthermore, among three models with M28T1, mass wasting occurs only in M28SqrtT1, the model with the highest $\bar{M}$ among these M28T1 models. 
%During the mass wasting, a curved fault scarp with $\sim$1 km relief is produced and it has a shape very similar to 13 $\degree$N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge (please refer to a detailed discussion in the next section). 
The trend of greater complexity for higher $\bar{M}$ continues in the group of M57T1 models. Corrugations are created earlier along the whole 20 km ridge segment than in the M28-T1 models. Unlike the M28T1 group, all three models in the M57-T1 group have mass wasting. %M57LinT1 ($\bar{M} =$ 0.5950), it begins to have tensile failure which releases tensional stress in the hanging wall and results in the delay of inward fault jump. 
The two M58 models have 3 or 4 inward fault jumps but the M57 models have at most two of them. Also, corrugations are created earlier in the M57 models than in the M58 ones, which suggests that corrugation favors a specific range of $\frac{\partial M}{\partial Z}$, not necessarily higher $\bar{M}$. Between M58SinT1 ($\bar{M} =$ 0.6834) and M58SqrtT1 ($\bar{M} =$ 0.6918), the major difference is M58SqrtT1 has twice inward fault jumps at the lower M side because M values are higher at the lower M side.

When comparing models with different weakening rates, the most obvious difference is that only type 2 models generates alternating faults. The models that exhibit the fault alternation do not create the mullion structure because the pattern of termination can not last long enough to produce the mullion structure. Also, they have neither tensile failure nor antithetic fault.

M58LinT2 ($\bar{M} =$ 0.6425) does not show the fault alternation, which suggests that not only the range of M (M58) but also the average M value along the ridge $\bar{M}$ are responsible for the fault alternation. This provides an upper limit of $\bar{M} =$ 0.6425 in our 3D models for producing long lasting detachment faults that can generate OCCs. Comparing M57T2 and M57T1 models show that M57T2 models generally have earlier inward fault jumps but later corrugations. For the model with constant M = 0.8 along the ridge axis, the inward fault jump and fault alternations have a period of $\sim$10 km of extension which is consistent with that of field observations. Corrugation, mullion structures, mass wasting, antithetic fault and tensile failure are not produced in constant M model M88ConT2 and it implies that varying M is necessary for producing those features.

\begin{figure}[h]

Adapted from \citep{MacLeod2009}. }
 \label{fig_Discussion_ResultsSummary_MacLeod2009}
\end{figure}

In addition, the upper limit of $\bar{M} = $ 0.6425 for allowing a long lasting detachment fault to produce an OCC in our model is consistent to the results from a near-bottom sidescan bathymetric profiler survey and sampling study of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 13 $\degree$N \citep{MacLeod2009}. As shown in Figrure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_ResultsSummary_MacLeod2009]{\ref{fig_Discussion_ResultsSummary_MacLeod2009}}, the average M value $\bar{M} =$ 0.63 $\pm$ 0.05 for the pink area where OCCs are present whereas when there is no OCC, $\bar{M} =$ 0.73 $\pm$ 0.03.

Under similar physical conditions of our model setup (e.g. thermal structure, rheology relationship, spreading velocity, weakening rate), the upper limit of $\bar{M} = $ 0.6425 predicts a boundary value between two observed morphological end members for slow spreading ridges: 1) long wavelength OCCs generated by a detachment fault; 2) high frequency abyssal hills results from symmetrical spreading of alternating high angle normal faults. Although the number of $\bar{M} = $ 0.6425 is highly consistent with natural observation (e.g. \citep{MacLeod2009}), we still need more works for a comprehensive result because model parameter such as viscosity of the underlying asthenosphere also contributes to whether fault alternates. For example, \citep{Allken2012} shows that higher value of viscosity of the ductile asthenosphere leads to better coupling between crust and mantle and promotes distributed muliple faulting rather than a focused long-lived detachment fault.

Previous 2D studies suggest that OCCs are most likely to form when M = 0.3 $\sim$ 0.5 [\citealp{Buck2005};\citealp{Tucholke2008}]. However, conflicts exist between model prediction and nature observation in both the upper and lower limits. For the upper limit conflict that OCCs are observed with M $>$ 0.5, \citet{Olive2010} suggests an explanation from a 2D model study that magma supplied in the ductile lower crust and upper mantle will not affect the faulting pattern and thus allows OCCs to be created under excessive diking. However, our 3D model results provides an alternative explanation that due to the along ridge coupling (i.e. torsion and shear), the region (M = 0.3 $\sim$ 0.5) along the ridge that promotes stable spreading by detachment faulting helps maintain the normal fault outside the region along the ridge. Once the detachment fault initiates along the whole ridge segment, it is very hard to modify the faulting pattern especially for a faster weakening rate (type 1). Thus, the detachemnt fault at the higher M side (M $>$ 0.5) can still last for more than 20 km of plates separation (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together}.M28LinT1}) before the fault alternation or inward fault jump ceases the exhuming process of the ultramafic mantle rocks. This along ridge coupling can also explain the conflict at the lower limit end when OCC is produced with observed M $<$ 0.3 (e.g., \citealp{Dick2008}; \citealp{Grimes2008}; \citealp{Baines2008}). Our 3D result suggests an extended range of M for OCCs formation than previous 2D studies (M = 0.3 $\sim$ 0.5) [\citealp{Buck2005};\citealp{Tucholke2008}]. 


\subsection{Comparing model results with natural observations}

%In this section, I compare the model behaviors with nature observations in terms of the following major model features: inward fault jump, fault alternation, mass wasting, hourglass shape median valley, mullion structure and corrugation.

\subsubsection{Inward fault jump}
\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998.eps}
 \caption[Schematic development of a megamullion from amagmatic to magmatic, adapted from \citep{Tucholke1998}.]{Schematic development of a megamullion. No vertical exaggeration. (a)$\sim$(c) shows the detachment fault evolution during amagmatic phase. (d) Increased magma supply pushed the detachment fault away from ridge axis and forms a new normal fault near the ridge axis (``inward fault jump''). Adapted from \citep{Tucholke1998}.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}
\end{figure}

The term ``inward fault jump'' is first suggested in a study of geological and geophysical data from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge \citep{Tucholke1998}. It is the end phase of a general evolution of an OCC as is illustrated in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}}. In the begining of a long amagmatic phase (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}.a$\sim$c}) of seafloor spreading, a high angle normal fault cuts throught the brittle lithosphere and roots in the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}.a}). When the fault keeps slipping, the breakaway moves off axis and the fault begin to rotate to a lower dip angle (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}.b}). Then, the exposed fault surface roll over and as the detachment fault keeps exhuming lower crust and upper mantle rocks, it generates a dome shape megamullion (OCC). The high angle normal faults cut the detachment fault surface where it is exposed to the seafloor is probably caused by the bending stresses during footwall roll over (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Tucholke1998}.c}). Then, when magma supply at the ridge center increases and pushes the detachment fault away from the ridge axis, the OCC formation is terminated by the new fault near the ridge axis which is termed as the ``inward fault jump''. As shown in the figure, initially, the footwall of this new fault is mostly composed of crust material like basalt, however, if this new fault can last a long period of time, it can also exhume lower ultramafic material.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_2_Dick2008_Kane.eps}

 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_Dick2008_Kane}
\end{figure}

In our model, most of the inward jumping faults last less than 5 km of plates extension before the mantle materials can be exhumed to the seafloor. However, the M28LinT1 model produces an inward fault jump lasts for $\sim$15 km of extension (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together}.M28LinT1}) and produces a dome-shaped OCC ajacent to the initial one further way from the ridge axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.h}). This behavior might explain the formation mechanism of the brother Abel and Cain domes of the Kane megamullion at 23 $\degree$N MAR. As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_2_Dick2008_Kane]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_Dick2008_Kane}}, our model behaviors are consistent with the nature observation in terms of the breakaway and the wavelength of the domes assuming M decreases form south to north along the ridge axis. First of all, the breakway of the detachment fault is further away from the ridge axis at the northern than the sourthern end. Second, the Abel and Cain domes are larger than the Adam and Eve domes because the inward fault jump lasts longer at where M is relatively lower.    

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Xu2009_SeismicV_Kane.eps}
 \caption{P wave isovelocity contours at 500 m below seafloor superimposed on bathymetry and simplified tectonic interpretation. Adapted from \citep{Xu2009}.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Xu2009_SeismicV_Kane}
\end{figure}

A seismic study \citep{Xu2009} showed that the Kane OCC is terminated at around 2.1 Myr ago when an eastward fault jump occured, i.e. when a new normal fault formed in the rift valley and captured a segment of the basaltic hanging wall. The velocity structure from their P wave tomography study verifies that the hanging wall block eastern to the Cain dome has a lower velocity corresponds to basaltic rocks (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Xu2009_SeismicV_Kane]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_Xu2009_SeismicV_Kane}}).

\subsubsection{Fault alternation}

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR.eps}
 \caption[Bathymetry from 12.8$\sim$14.2 $\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge.]{Bathymetry from 12.8$\sim$14.2 $\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Crossection A$\sim$A$^{\prime}$ and B$\sim$B$^{\prime}$ are 5 times vertical exagerated. From GeoMapApp.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR}
\end{figure}

For slow-to-intermediate spreading ridges, the off-axis morphologies have two end members. One is the high-frequency abyssal hills that are relatively symmetrical across the ridge axis. They are usually found closer to the ridge segment center (crossection A-A$^{\prime}$ in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR}}). The other is the long wavelength asymmetrically spreading OCCs (crossection B-B$^{\prime}$ in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR}}). What is the mechanism for this distinct difference along the ridge? The fault alternation behavior in our model provides a 3D perspective for answering the question. When $\bar{M}$ is higher than 0.6425 with slower weakening rate (type 2), short wavelength abyssal hills are generated. For example, M88ConT2 produces abyssal hills with $\sim$10 km in wavelength due to fault alternation (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Result_Summary_1_Combine_together}.M88ConT2}; Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_3]{\ref{fig_Results1_3}}). Note that the wavelength of the abysall hills in our models is consistent with the nature observation as marked in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_13-14N_MAR}}. While when $\bar{M} <=-$0.6425, OCC is produced.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results_Weakening_1_tradeOff_bend_weak.png}
 \caption[Trade-off between change in bending force $\Delta F_{b}$ and weakening in the fault interface $\Delta F_{w}$. Adapted from \citep{Lavier2000}.]{Trade-off between change in bending force $\Delta F_{b}$ and weakening in the fault interface $\Delta F_{w}$. H is the thickness of the brittle crust and $\gamma$ is the size of initial weak perturbation and A defines the maximum bending force change. Adapted from \citep{Lavier2000}. (For more details, please refer to \citep{Lavier2000})}
 \label{fig_Results_Weakening_1}
\end{figure}

The parameters that controls fault alternation have been proposed by \citet{Lavier2000}. \citet{Lavier2000} focused on the trade-off between bending forces ($\Delta F_{b}$) as a function of fault offset $\Delta X$ and force change due to strain weakening ($\Delta F_{w}$) that is also a function of  $\Delta X$. They showed that the strength weakening on the existing fault combined with bending force resists further offset of the fault plays a major role in determining the stress state at the regions other than the active fault. Their analysis explains how higher characteristic fault slip ($\Delta X_{c}$) or slower strain weakening results in multiple faults rather than only one fault lasting. %Whether conjugate fault and even multiple faults can be produced depends on the local stress condition. 
 As $\Delta X$ increases on a fault at a spreading center, the change in bending force $\Delta F_{b}$ increases and the strength at the fault interface decreases due to weakening $\Delta F_{w}$ (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakening_1]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakening_1}}). If the net force change $\Delta F = \Delta F_{b}+ \Delta F_{w}$ is positive, it means that it becomes harder to maintain the existing fault and stress begins to accummulate at other areas which eventually break another fault. $\Delta F_{b}$ initially increases fast with respect to $\Delta X$ and then when the detachment fault surface roll over, $\Delta F_{b}$ reaches its peak value and begins to decrease a little and maintains at a constant value. If the strain weakenging is fast enough that the net effect force $\Delta F$ is always negative, then most of the stress will be released by the existing fault and thus no conjugate or multiple faults will be generated. 
Our model results are consistent with this analysis in that only weakening (slower weakening with higher $\Delta X_{c}$) produces an alternating normal fault on the conjugate plate.

%Based on the previous experience in pseudo-2D models and \citep{Lavier2000},  when M$>0.5$, the frequency of normal faulting alternation is higher for higher characteristic fault offset ($\Delta X_{c}$) of Type two weakening compared to Type one weakening. However, for the reference model two, M88ConT2 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}), interesting enough, when comparing pseudo-2D and 3D models with Type two weakening under case of M$=0.8$, even though the 3D Model has a larger $\Delta X_{c}$ of 1km than that of pseudo-2D model of 0.5kmr, the 3D model M88ConT2 has a lower frequency of faulting alternation. Since M is constant 0.8 along the ridge-axis, the effect of along ridge couplingthat resists alternation need not be considered. One possibility is that the resisting bending force increase in a higher rate than linear with respect to increasing the length of the ridge segment (Z$_{max}$ km).  

\subsubsection{Mass wasting}

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_1_13N_MAR_CutBack.eps}
 \caption[Comparing bathymetry at 13$\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the mass wasting behavior of M28SqrtT1.]{Comparing bathymetry at 13$\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the mass wasting behavior of M28SqrtT1. The model topography is a mirror symetric flip according to the dash line, it shows the case of M varies in a square root functional form from 0.2 to 0.8 to 0.2. The bathymetry image is generated by GeoMapApp \citep{Ryan2009}.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_1_13N_MAR_CutBack}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_3_MassWasting_13-15N_bathymetry_magnetizaion.eps}
 \caption{Bathymetry and magnetization of 13$\sim$15 $\degree$N MAR. Adapted from \citep{Smith2008}.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_3_MassWasting_13-15N_bathymetry_magnetizaion}
\end{figure}

The mass wasting behavior in M28SqrtT1 model produces a fault scarp of $\sim$1km in relief, 40km in length along isochron-parallel direction. It forms when the detachment fault rolls over and induces bending stressses that generate the high angle fault which cuts the weak detachment fault surface and decouples the spreading breakaway and the highly deformed fault hanging wall. The topography at 13 $\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge also has a fault scarp with very similar curved geometry with $\sim$1km in relief. However, the 1 km relief might be relfecting the model resolution of 1 km so further investigation is necessaray. In addition, a magnetic anomaly study of the region from \citep{Smith2008} reveals a perfect match at the 13$\degree$5$^{\prime}$N between the bathymetry and the magnetization (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_3_MassWasting_13-15N_bathymetry_magnetizaion]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_3_MassWasting_13-15N_bathymetry_magnetizaion}}). It might imply that the block at 13$\degree$5$^{\prime}$N adjacent to the curved fault scarp has a relative displacement toward the East and thus provides an evidence for the mass wasting behavior of the block.   
 
\subsubsection{Hourglass-shaped median valley}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_4_hourglass_22N_MAR.eps}
  \caption[Hourglass median valley at 22 $\degree$ 30 $^{\prime}$N MAR.]{Hourglass median valley at 22 $\degree$ 30 $^{\prime}$N MAR. Image is generated from GeoMapApp.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_4_hourglass_22N_MAR}
\end{figure}   

Due to the variation in diking along the ridge-axis, an hourglass shape of median valley is also produced in the model where the narrowest center corresponds to the region with higher magma supply (M=$0.8$). An hourglass-shaped median valley is frequently observed in the nature along the slow-to-intermediate spreading ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridges \citep{Sempere1993}, where the waist of the hourglass is usually narrower and shallower. From an analysis of the sea beam bathymetry along the MAR between 24 $\degree$ 00 $^{\prime}$N and 30 $\degree$ 40 $^{\prime}$N \citep{Sempere1993}, nine hourglass shape valleys are identified. They share similar dimensional scale ($\sim$40 km $\times$ $\sim$40 km) with our model. For example, there is an hourglass around 22 $\degree$ 30 $^{\prime}$ that is 45 km long and 15 km wide (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_4_hourglass_22N_MAR]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_4_hourglass_22N_MAR}}). The observed width and depth of the hourglass can be used for inferring which evolution stage the rift valley is in. For instance, the one shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_4_hourglass_22N_MAR]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_4_hourglass_22N_MAR}} corresponds to an early stage of our model because it has a relatively symmetrical and narrow shape (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_3_2_hourglass_evolution]{\ref{fig_Results_3_2_hourglass_evolution}.b}). In addition, the relatively small variation in the valley's width along the ridge is more corresponding to M57 and M58 models than the M28 models. 

\subsubsection{Mullion structure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Discussion_Observation_5_Mullion_Kane.eps}
  \caption[Bathymetry around the Kane OCC at 23 $\degree$N MAR.]{Bathymetry around the Kane OCC at 23 $\degree$N MAR. Image is generated from GeoMapApp.}
 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_5_Mullion_Kane}
\end{figure}   

Mullion structures are frequently observed on the surface of OCCs. For instance, the mullion structures on the surface of of the Cain dome has a wavelength of $\sim$3.5 km as marked in the Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_5_Mullion_Kane]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_5_Mullion_Kane}.B$\sim$B$^\prime$}. The geometry and length scale of these mullion structures bears significant visual similarity with those of our reference model, M28LinT1 (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_3_2_6_mullion_evolution]{\ref{fig_Results_3_2_6_mullion_evolution}}). Model results indicate that the mullion structure mostly forms when the termination of the detachment fault has a curved shape that can last for a long period of time and the spreading-parallel mullion structure is produced following the shape of the termination. Where the termination is curved toward the ridge axis corresponds to the larger and higher part of the mullion structure. As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_2_Dick2008_Kane]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_2_Dick2008_Kane}}, the spatial distribution of the mullion structure of the Cain dome is consistent with the termination that is curved inward to the ridge axis.

\subsubsection{Corrugations}

\begin{figure}[h]

 \label{fig_Discussion_Observation_Corrugations16N_M58SinT1}
\end{figure}

Observed corrugations are also produced in the models. For instance, the spreading-parallel corrugations with wavelength of several kilometers that appear on the surface of the OCC at 16 $\degree$N Mid-Atlantic Ridge are reproduced by model M58SinT1 (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_Corrugations16N_M58SinT1]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_Corrugations16N_M58SinT1}}).

As decribed in the ``Results'' section, the corrugations are formed due to the moving off axis tensile failure which results from the asynchronous faulting along the ridge. This mechanism is further verified by simpler 3D models.

When seeds (elements with prescribed plastic strain of 0.5) are partially added along the ridge segment for simulating the effects of asynchronous faulting where normal fault initiates earlier at the region with initial seeds, corrugations are produced by the model (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_simple_models_for_corrugation_mechanism]{\ref{fig_Discussion_simple_models_for_corrugation_mechanism}.a}). 
However, when 10 km of sea water pressure is added on top of the seafloor to suppress tensile failure, no corrugation is produced (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_simple_models_for_corrugation_mechanism]{\ref{fig_Discussion_simple_models_for_corrugation_mechanism}.b}). This verifies that the corrugation is related to tensile failure at the exposed fault plane.

In addition, when seeds are added along the whole ridge segment, which results in synchronous faulting, no corrugation is generated (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Discussion_Observation_6_Corrugation_simplerModel_4kwaterdepth_along_ridge_seed]{\ref{fig_Discussion_Observation_6_Corrugation_simplerModel_4kwaterdepth_along_ridge_seed}}). This verifies that along ridge asynchronous faulting induced isochron-parallel tensional stress is necessary for creating corrugations.

As mentioned in \citep{Smith2014}, wavelength of corrugations varies from meters to kilometers. Different scales corrugations sometimes coexist on the surface of a single OCC (e.g. \citealp{MacLeod2009}). Although corrugation is a widely observed phenomenon, its formation mechanism is still mysterious \citep{Smith2006}. Several hypotheses were proposed. \citet{Spencer1999} explains the corrugation by applying a continuous casting model which is analogical to the industrial casting process that the hot and ductile footwall of a detachment fault is continuously exhumed to the surface while being casted by the cold and brittle hanging wall. The domal shape of the corrugation is produced following the shape of the hanging wall. This hypothesis is similar to the formation mechanism of the mullion structure produced in our models. \citet{Smith2014} proposes another hypothesis that pre-existing offsetted faults along the ridge break through and connect to each other and form a curved termination that can produce corrugations. This is called the anastomosing behavior (e.g. \citealp{Ferrill1999}; \citealp{Wong2008}) and is also produced in our models especially when there is inward fault jumps, antithetic faults or tensile failures happening at only part of the ridge segment which perturbs the continuity of the termination along the ridge. In addition, \citet{Tucholke1998} mentioned that %with respect to the tectonic configuration at mid-ocean ridges, 
as oceanic lithosphere moves off axis, horizontally isochron-parallel extension is possible due to the contraction of the cooling lithosphere.

Besides these hypotheses, I proposed that the asynchronous faulting induced tensile failure due to the varying M along the ridge axis as another possible formation mechanism for the relatively uniform $\sim$2 km corrugations. These corrugations can also be superimposed onto the surfaces of mullion structures or OCCs.

 \label{fig_Results4_5}
\end{figure}   

The cut back happens mostly in the square root model. Since the linear model and the square root model have more obvious difference in terms of the cut back behavior, here, we only compare linear and square root. There are several factors contribute to the cut back behavior. First, at the higher M side, the amount of diking for the square root model is ubiquitously larger than that of the linear one (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results3_1]{\ref{fig_Results3_1}}). This leads to a slower bending detachment at the high M side for the square root model. Second, the totoal length of the ridge segment with M$>0.5$ for the square root model is also longer than that of the linear one (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results3_1]{\ref{fig_Results3_1}}). This results in that at the low M side, $\sigma_{xz}$ is focused at low Z ajacent to the ridge-axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_1}.e}), however for linear is spread out to Z higher than 10. Third, due to higher value of $\frac{dM}{dZ}$ for square root when Z$<5$, the along ridge-axis shear $\sigma_{xz}$ for square root will be accummulating faster, which produces larger strike-slip force to cut the hanging wall at the low M side. Fourth, as observed in the model (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_1}.c}), the parallel to spreading direction offset between breakaways along the ridge-axis is 4km for the square root model compared to 3km for the linear model. This causes the square root model to experience bigger shear stress $\sigma_{xy}$ both immediately beneath and above the fault interface at the low M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_1}.d}). Fifth, as shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_8]{\ref{fig_Results4_8}}, due to bending of the crust at the footwall side, below the blue neutral plane, $\sigma_{xx}>0$, meaning tensional stress being accummulated as fault develops. The resulting force tends to unbend the bent crust and drag down the connecting surface (the future decoupled hanging wall). All five factors together assist in the decouple of the hanging wall at the low M side as described in detail in the next paragraph.

 \label{fig_Results4_6}
\end{figure}

%(Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_6]{\ref{fig_Results4_6}})reveals that
In the Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}}, the hanging wall rebounds backwards to the dike in a high velocity (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.b,e (velocity)}) accompanied with a sudden topography drop (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.b) compared to c); d) compared to e) (in the second row)}). This behavior is triggered when the front tip of the weak detachment extends further away from the ridge-axis and reaches a pre-accummulated shear zone (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_5]{\ref{fig_Results4_5}}). The pre-accummulated shear zone adds extra shear force to the weak (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}}.d(third row: plastic strain)) as well as shear stresses accummulated (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.d}(fourth and fifth row: $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$)) fault interface and together with the five factors mentioned in the previous paragraph result in the cut back behavior. The cut back produces a continuous high angle fault scarp with a relief of $\sim 1km$ aligns to the initial breakaway and extends for about 20 kilometer in length (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.e (second row: topography)}). Its distance to the ridge-axis varies along the Z-axis and this result can be used to indicate the magma supply variation in the nature. \add[XT]{To be discussed in observation comparison section. as a reminder}

During the cut back process, the tensional bending stress are released at the low M side ($0<$Z$<7$) in the left tip of the bended crust (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_6]{\ref{fig_Results4_6}.a compared to b}), however, in the higher M side, the tensional bending stress keeps accummulating due to the far field extension (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_6]{\ref{fig_Results4_6}.c compared to d}). This behavior assists in the decouple between low M and high M side hanging walls. 

Once the cut back happens at 162.5kyr, the $\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xz}$ and $\sigma_{xx}$ are released (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.e (fourth and fifth row: $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$)}). The plastic strain near the ridge-axis at low M side reaches a maximum of $\sim$0.9 (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.e (third row: plastic strain)}) compared to $\sim$0.3 before and after. This is due to the sudden backward motion squeezes the end element of the hanging wall near the ridge-axis and later be released by the continuous extension.

After the cut back, the termination of the detachment recedes backwards for about 7 kilometer towards the ridge-axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.f (third row: plastic strain)}) (termination fronts are always consistent with tension stresses in $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ as well as with plastic strain front(due to healing, high plastic strain region corresponds only to region with continuously deformation) (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_1}} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_2]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_2}})). This behavior helps maintain a high angle normal fault. Different from the linear and sinusoidal models that the detachments at the low M side will rotate to a very low angle, square root model doesn't. In addition, $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$ soon fill in the area between cut back created fault scarp and the new termination (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.f (fourth and fifth row: $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$)} because $\sigma_{xy}$ always accummulates immediately beneath the normal fault interface and the red $\sigma_{xz}$ left to the new termination is due to the along ridge-axis variatioin in the rate of fault slip (low M side larger).  

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results4_9_sqrt_cut_back_new_fault_chase.eps}
  \caption{M28SqrtT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}). New fault front chase after initial abandoned breakaway.}
 \label{fig_Results4_9}
\end{figure}

There is one phenomenon very interesting and counter-intuitive that worth describing here. After the cut back, and termination retreat, the evolution of the detachment fronts is opposite to initiall or to the general behavior in the linear and sinusoidal models. The termination front at the high M side extends faster and further after the cut back (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_9]{\ref{fig_Results4_9}}). This is partly related to the unbending decouple phenomenon we described ealier that the tensional stress are released at the low M side but continues to accummulate in the high M side during the cut back unbending in the low M side. Since the tensional stress is released in the low M side, it needs time to accummulate to where it was and then start from there to drag the new near ridge-axis fault away from the ridge-axis while at the high M side the increasing tensional stress will directly lead to a fast extending fault front. Thus create the behavior. \add[XT]{One question is, how to explain that the fault front is moving much faster than the initial abandoned breakaway? New fault front soon reach the old breakaway.} This phenomenon is largely responsible for the corrugations observed. It create a ``X'' shape ``scan'' that first ``scan'' the topography with faster low M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.d and e}) and then with faster high M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_9]{\ref{fig_Results4_9}.c and d}). This results in curved terminations with hundreds to several kilometers wavelengths that directly create parallel to spreading direction corrugations.

\end{figure}

In addition, the higher $\sigma_{xx}$ in the median valley of conjugate plate at low M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_7]{\ref{fig_Results4_7}}) is due to the brittle crust is thinnest at the median valley, thus when same amount of force propagates from far field extension to the center median valley, the stress will increases.

\iffalse  tables with model features
There are several behaviors that are controlled by the model parameters. Generally, only M58 models with type 2 weakening produce aternating faults on both side of the ridge axis. All the models show corrugations. As for faulting patterns in terms of evolution frequency, usually Square root is more dynamic than Sinusoidal than Linear, M58 is more dynamic than M57 than M28.

Following tables are a summery of the model behaviors with respect to different setup parameters.

Generally, all models forms a median valley that deepens and widens toward the lower M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}}) except the reference model with constant M$=0.8$ (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_3]{\ref{fig_Results1_3}}). The topography oberseved in our models, to the first order, is controlled by the spatial and temporal distributions of faulting and to the second order, results from elastically deformation (e.g. The gradual deepening and widening of the median valley; The bending of the crust at the footwall side of the detatchment fault results in a domal shape of the fault interface as a mechanism for producing the dome shape of OCCs). 

The pattern of the deformation (faulting and elastic deformation) is controlled by the evolving stress in the crust in terms of its distribution and magnitude. The stress evolution is a result of the interaction processes between tectonics and magmatism. Due to constant seafloor spreading, tensional stress orthogonal to the ridge-axis in the crust keeps accummulating. At the same time, along ridge-axis varying diking partially accommodates the stress from far field extension and perturbs the homogeneity state of stress distribution along the ridge-axis. Accumulated stress will be largely released when the tensile or shear failures establish.

Since the model behavior is very complicated. We will focus on the effects being brought by the along ridge-axis variation in diking. Thus, it is worth considering a thought experiment with two end members: One, the along ridge-axis coupling is rigid, so that even along ridge axis variation in M exist, once a fault determined to develop, it will cut through the whole model domain along the ridge-axis(Z-axis) simultaneously. The other end member is that there is totally no coupling along the ridge-axis. So that each slice of crossection profile across the ridge behave separately without being influenced by its neighbour to a extreme that the model behavior is just a combination of 20 pseudo-2D models piled up along ridge-axis with their own M. (IMPORTANT: this suggests the importance and urgence for making clear conclusion and results description for previous pseudo-2D models results. However, one difficulty here is that the characteristic fault offset $\Delta X_{c}$ is different between 2D and 3D models.)
