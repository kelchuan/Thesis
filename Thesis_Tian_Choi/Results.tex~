Currently, we have three factors controlling the model behaviors. They are three ranges of M variation along the ridge axis, three functional forms of M variation and two types of weakening rate. Generally, all models forms a median valley that deepens and widens toward the lower M side. Initially, since the fault displacement at lower M side is bigger than higher M side, the break away extends further and the detachment fault bends faster in low M side.
