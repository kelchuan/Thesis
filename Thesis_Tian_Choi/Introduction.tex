\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:Intro}  % <>? why ch: befor Intro

Around 70\% area of the Earth's crust is the oceanic crust. New oceanic crust is constantly forming at the mid-ocean ridges (MORs), the longest mountain chains on the Earth. Seismic and volcanic activities are frequently happening along the MORs due to incessant seafloor spreading and magma upwelling. The interactions between the tectonics and magmatism along the MORs are considered to be responsible for the variations in the seafloor \annote[EC]{topography}{morphology would be more generic and thus better in this context.}.
%
%High-resolution multi-beam bathymetric data have revealed various characteristics of the topography along and across MORs. Two major questions have stimulated people's interests. First, what creates differences in axial topography between slow (median valley) and fast spreading ridges (axial high)? Second, for slow spreading ridges, why does topography from the center to tip of the ridge vary from high frequency symmetric abyssal hills to asymmetric long wavelength oceanic core complexes (OCCs)?
%
Geodynamic modeling along with a variety of geological, geophysical observation and lab experiment constraints have been used to study how does the interaction system between tectonics and magmatism at the MORs work under geological time scale \note[EC]{Add some referecnes}.

\subsection{Review of Literature}
According to \citep{Fowler2004}, variations in mid-ocean ridge morphologies are mainly controlled by four factors: magma supply, tectonic strain, hydrothermal circulation and spreading rate.\add[XT]{Clarify the relationship between the four factors and try to cite the original work for each of them. (in Fowler2004, they didn't mention the ref for these four factors, page417 Chapter9.4.1)} Among them, the spreading rate shows the strongest correlation with the ridge morphology. Slow-to-intermediate spreading ridges (half spreading rate less than 4 cm/yr) produce median valleys that are typically 10$\sim$20 km wide and 1$\sim$2 km deep (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridges, Fig. \ref{fig_Intro1_1}. Fast-spreading ridges (half spreading rate greater than 5 cm/yr) like the East Pacific Rise have axial highs that are 10$\sim$20 km wide, 0.3$\sim$0.5 km high (Fig. \ref{fig_Intro1_3}).

Slow spreading ridges exhibit along-axis variations in the width and depth of median valleys, crustal thickness and off-axis morphology.  Figure~\ref{fig_Intro2_1} shows that the topographic profile near to the center of the ridge segment (A-A$^{\prime}$) is rather symmetric and has higher frequency. The maximum relief is about 1 km. In constrast, the near-tip profile (B-B$^{\prime}$) is asymmetric, has much lower frequency, and shows a greater relief ($\sim$3 km). 
%The depth and crustal thickness along the ridge valley also varies. 
The maximum along-axis variation in crustal thickness $\Delta H_{c}$ is linearly increasing with segment length L \citep{Chen1999} and the relationship is $\Delta H_{c}$(L) = 0.0206L (Figure~\ref{fig_Intro3_1}). \note[EC]{Discussion on off-axis morphology is missing.}

The huge geologic structure is a window for learning lower crust and upper mantle because it is believed to be a result of exhumation of deeper material to the seafloor through tectonic processes.

%\subsection{Related work}
%\label{ch:related}
Magma supply at MORs is mostly a passive process when no hot plume is present \citep{Fowler2004}. Hot mantle rises up to fill the vacated room being created by plate separation and decompression leads to partial melting of the hot mantle. The melt upwells due to both pressure difference and buoyancy from lateral density difference. When the melt solidifies near the surface, it forms new crust. Melt can also feed dikes at the spreading center. Diking releases extensional stresses resulting from far-field forces (e.g. slab pull) that drive seafloor spreading.

The passive nature of magma upwelling at MORs leads to the major difference between fast and slow spreading ridges in the amount of magma supply. \note[EC]{Revise the rest of this paragraph. It's a repetition of the previous paragraph and not a proper explanation of the first sentence of this paragraph.} At the fast spreading ridges, the rate of creating new space is greater than at the slow spreading ridges such that passive magma upwelling is also more supply is always sufficient for dikes to accommodate plate separation. However, the amount of magma supplied in the form of dikes at the slow spreading ridges and the oceanic lithosphere experiences internal deformations (i.e. tectonics process like normal faulting) when the accumulated extensional stress exceeds the strength of the crust.

\citet{Buck2005} attributed the contrasting faulting patterns and ocean floor morphology of fast- and slow-spreading ridges to the difference in the amount of diking-accommodated plate extension. They defined the ratio between the rates of diking and plate separation as M = $V_{dx}/2V_{x}$, where $V_{dx}$ is the rate of opening by diking at a MOR and $V_{x}$ is the half spreading rate of the MOR. According to this definition, M = 1 represents the case where dike injection is so frequent that magma supply is sufficient to release all the tensional stresses from plate separation. M = 0 corresponds to the case of no magma supply, in which diking does not account for any of the plate motion and therefore plates kinematics requires plates to go through internal deformations. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_Intro5_1}, an axial high forms at a fast spreading ridge (M = 1) due to buoyancy from lateral density difference across ridge axis but a median valley forms at a slow-spreading ridge (M = 0.5) due to near-axis normal faulting, which is in turn caused by the stretching of oceanic lithosphere.

%\citet[Buck2005}
%\annote[XT]{They didn't explicitly mention the ratio M, and they cannot remesh (the dike is not repeatedly widening), the dike in Poliakov and Buck is a vertical place where initial shear stress is set to zero and normal stress is set to be the same as lithostatic pressure, I guess it is still different with the following M we are going to describe, maybe Buck, 2005 is the first work to explicitly proposed M} {\note[EC]{I think M factor was originally proposed by Poliakov and Buck, 1998} }also showed that the ratio of the diking-accommodated portion to the total plate motion can efficiently parameterize the kinematics of repeated diking.}

\citet{Tucholke2008} expand the investigation on the role of M in the mid-ocean ridge mechanics. They focus on the faulting behaviors of slow spreading ridges and find that the OCCs are most likely to form when M varies from 0.3 to 0.5. When M = 0.7 (Fig.~\ref{fig_Intro6_1}A), repeated diking pushes faults that have formed at the spreading center away from the ridge axis. Since the thickness of the brittle layer increases away from the ridge axis, frictional and bending energy for maintaining the fault also increases. When the energy needed for maintaining an existing fault exceeds the energy for breaking a new near-axis fault, the old fault will cease to be active and the new one starts to accommodate extension. When M = 0.3$\sim$0.5, the normal fault remains active for a long time and rotates to a very low angle normal fault (detachment fault), exhuming the lower crust and mantle materials to the seafloor. When M is less than 0.3, most of the tension is accommodated by intra-plate deformations rather than by diking and as a result, faulting pattern is more complicated and unsteady.

\subsection{Statement of Research Purpose}
The M-factor formulation used in the previous 2D models \citep{Tucholke2008,Buck2005} successfully explained major features found in across-ridge profiles of seafloor bathymetry. However, 2D models have limitations in studying the along-ridge variations in morphology and faulting patterns. Magma supply at fast spreading ridges seems always sufficient for accommodating plate motions with little variation along the ridge axis. The relatively uniform topography along fast spreading ridges is considered to be consistent with the uniform abundance of the magma supply. However, along the slow spreading ridges, bathymetry, gravity anomaly and results from reflection and refraction seismology show strong correlation with variation in crustal thickness \citep{Ryan2009, Chen1999, Lin1990, Tolstoy1993}. Because oceanic crust is mainly formed by upwelled magma at the ridge, variation in the thickness of the crust implies variation in magma supply. At slow spreading ridges, the degree of cooling by hydrothermal circulation, thermal structures and even local spreading rate \citep{Baines2008} also varies both along and across the ridge axis and they appear interrelated. Thus, for slow-to-intermediate spreading ridges, the interactions between tectonics and magmatism at MORs are inevitably 3D processes and 3D numerical models are desirable for better understanding factors controlling both across- and along-ridge topography variations. 

The purpose of this thesis is to extend the M-factor formulation originally developed for 2D models to 3D by implementing it into a 3D numerical modeling code SNAC (StGermaiN Analysis of Continua) \citep{Choi2008}. By systematically exploring the behaviors of the 3D models and comparing them with observations, we will be able to better understand how the mid-ocean ridge magmatism and tectonic deformations interact.
