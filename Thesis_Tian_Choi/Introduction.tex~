\section{Introduction}
\label{ch:Intro}  % <>? why ch: befor Intro

Around 70\% of the Earth's crust is oceanic crust and the mid-ocean ridges (MORs), the longest mountain chains on the Earth, are where new crust are forming with a multitude of seismic and volcanic activities. To study how new crust is created and how MORs evolve is significant for Earth Sciences.  Geodynamic modeling along with a variety of geological, geophysical observation and lab experiment constraints have been used to study how the MORs work as a system under geological time scale.

\subsection{Research Questions}
High-resolution multi-beam bathymetry has revealed various characteristics of topography along and across MOR axis. Three specific questions stimulate people's interests most. First, what causes the distinct difference in axial topography between slow and fast spreading ridges. Second, for slow spreading ridges, why does topography along ridge varies and how to explain many features observed. Third, why do oceanic core complexes (OCCs) form and what is the mechanism. 

%\subsection{Background}

\subsection{Review of Literature}
According to \citep{Fowler2004}, variations in  mid-ocean ridge morphologies are mainly controlled by four factors: magma supply, tectonic strain, hydrothermal circulation and spreading rate. Among them, the spreading rate is the most important. Slow-to-intermediate spreading centers (half spreading rate less than 4cm/year) produce median valleys that are typically 10$\sim$20km wide and 1$\sim$2km deep (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridges, Figure 1(a)). Fast-spreading centers (half spreading rate greater than 5cm/year) have axial highs that are 10$\sim$20 km wide, 0.3$\sim$0.5 km high (e.g., East Pacific Rise, Figure 1(b)).

\end{figure}
Slow spreading ridges exhibit along-axis variations as well in terms of the width and depth of median valleys and the off-axis morphology.  Figure~\ref{fig_Intro2_1} shows that the topographic profile nearer to the center of the ridge segment (A-A') is rather symmetric and has higher frequency. The maximum relief is about 1km. In constrast, the near-tip profile (B-B') is asymmetric and has much lower frequency and a greater relief ($\sim$3km). The bathymetry and crustal thickness along the ridge valley also varies. From \citep{Chen1999}, the maximum along-axis variation in crustal thickness $\Delta H_{c}$ is linearly increasing with segment length $L$, and the relationship is $\Delta H_{c}(L)=0.0206L$ (Figure~\ref{fig_Intro3_1}).

The huge geologic structure is a window for learning lower crust and upper mantle because it is believed to be a result of exhumation of deeper material to the seafloor through tectonic processes.

%\subsection{Related work}
%\label{ch:related}
Magma supply at MORs is mostly a passive process when no hot plume presents \citep{Fowler2004}. Hot mantle rises up to fill the vacated room being created by plate separation and decompression will lead to partial melting of the hot mantle. The melt upwells due to both pressure difference and buoyancy from lateral density difference. When the melt solidifies near the surface, it forms new crust. This diking process can also release extensional stresses result from far-field driving forces.

The passive nature of magma supply results in the major difference between fast and slow spreading ridges in the amount of magma supply. At the fast spreading ridges, magma supply is always sufficient for accommodating plate separation by filling the space by dikes. However, the amount of magma supplied in the form of dikes is not as much at slow spreading ridges and the oceanic lithosphere experiences internal deformations (i.e. tectonics process like normal faulting) when the accumulated extensional stress exceeds the strength of the crust. 

\citet{Buck2005} attributed the contrasting faulting patterns and ocean floor morphology of fast- and slow-spreading ridges to the difference in the amount of plate extension accommodated by diking. They defined the ratio between the rates of diking and plate separation as M$=V_{dx}/2V_{x}$, where $V_{dx}$ is the extensional velocity of a widening dike and $V_{x}$ is the half spreading rate of the MOR. According to this definition, M $=1$ represents the case where diking is frequent enough to release all the tensional stresses from plate separation. M $=0$ corresponds to the case of no magma supply, in which diking does not account for any of the plate motion and therefore plates kinematics requires plates to go through internal deformations. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_Intro5_1}, an axial high forms at a fast spreading ridge (M=1) due to buoyancy from lateral density difference across ridge axis but a median valley forms at a slow-spreading ridge (M=0.5) due to near-axis normal faulting, which is in turn caused by the stretching of oceanic lithosphere.

%\annote[XT]{They didn't explicitly mention the ratio M, and they cannot remesh (the dike is not repeatedly widening), the dike in Poliakov and Buck is a vertical place where initial shear stress is set to zero and normal stress is set to be the same as lithostatic pressure, I guess it is still different with the following M we are going to describe, maybe Buck, 2005 is the first work to explicitly proposed M} {\note[EC]{I think M factor was originally proposed by Poliakov and Buck, 1998} }also showed that the ratio of the diking-accommodated portion to the total plate motion can efficiently parameterize the kinematics of repeated diking.}

\citet{Tucholke2008} expanded the investigation on the role of M in the mid-ocean ridge mechanics. They focused on faulting behaviors of slow spreading ridges and find that the OCCs are most likely to form when M varies from 0.3 to 0.5. As shown in Figure 5, when M=0.7, repeated diking pushes faults forming at the spreading center away from axis. Since the thickness of the brittle layer increases away from the ridge axis, frictional and bending energy for maintaining the fault also increases. When it exceeds the energy for breaking a new near-axis fault, the old fault will be replaced by the new one. When M=0.3$\sim$0.5, the normal faults remains active for a long time to become detachment faults, exhuming the lower crust and mantle materials to the seafloor. When M is less than 0.3, most of the tension is accommodated by intra-plate deformations rather than by diking and as a result, faulting pattern is more complicated and unsteady.

\subsection{Statement of Research Purpose}
The M-factor formulation used in these previous 2D models successfully explained major features found in across-ridge profiles of seafloor bathymetry. However, 2D models have limitations in studying the along ridge-axis interactions, especially when important variables are not constant along the ridge axis. Magma supply at fast spreading ridges seems always sufficient for accommodating plate motions with little variation along the ridge axis. The relatively uniform topography along fast spreading ridges is considered to be consistent with the uniformly abundance of magma supply. However, along the slow spreading ridges, bathymetry, gravity anomaly and results from reflection and refraction seismology show good correlation with variation in crustal thickness \citep{Ryan2009, Chen1999, Lin1990, Tolstoy1993}. Because oceanic crust is mainly formed by upwelled magma at the ridge, variation in the thickness of the crust implies variation in magma supply. At slow spreading ridges, hydrothermal cooling, thermal structures and even local spreading rate \citep{Baines2008} also varies both along and across the ridge axis and they appear interrelated. Thus, for slow-to-intermediate spreading ridges, the interactions between tectonics and magmatism at MORs are inevitably 3D processes and 3D numerical models are desirable for better understanding factors controlling both across- and along-ridge variations.
