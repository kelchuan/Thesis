\section{Results}
%\add[XT]{choose some points in the model domain like Choi 2008 did, to monitor the values changes with time (e.g. In VisIt use Query to obtain stress with time for quantatatively analyzing the model behaviors)}
In this ``Results'' chapter, I first walk through the reference model (M28LinT1) and compare it with a constant M model (M88ConT2). Then, I describe in detail the major characteristics of the models. Finally, I compare the models in terms of 1) two types of the weakening rates; 2) three types of the ranges of M variation and 3) three types of the functional forms of M variation.

\subsection{Reference model M28LinT1}\label{sec_M28LinT1}

This figure needs to be revised that the plastic strain scale is actually changing for different time, a way to revise it is to maintain a constant color scale or attach a color scale for each time. Also, it seems a little bit small and two rows is not as preferable as one row or one column to better express the concept of linear time series evolution.}}

I consider the model with M varies linearly from 0.2 to 0.8 along the ridge axis with type 1 weakening rate (M28LinT1) as our reference model. The major characteristics of the model are indicated in the Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}}. They are breakaway (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.c}); oceanic core complex (OCC) (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.d}); terminations of the detachment faults where the active faulting interfaces reache the seafloor (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.e}); new high angle normal faults forming near the ridge axis, termed as ``inward fault jump''; corrugations (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.f}) and mullion structures (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.g}); and the side-by-side ``brother domes'' (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.h}).    

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}}, the model creates a median valley that widens and deepens with increasing plate extension (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.a.b.c}). The rate of its widening and deepening at a specific location along the ridge is inversely proportional to the M value (i.e. rate of local magma supply). %OCCs with more than one kilometer in relief and tens of kilometers in wavelentgh are produced. One interesting behavior worth noting is that corrugations with wavelengths of hundred-to-thousand meters and amplitudes of ten-to-hundred meters are also produced.

For the first 7.5 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.a}), %high angle ($\sim$60 $\degree$)
normal faults (represented by localized plastic strain) begin to form near the ridge axis.
%The angles of the faults are consistent with  Anderson's theory of faulting mechanics for a frictional angle of 30 $\degree$.
Because stresses due to plate motions accummulate faster at the lower M side than at the higher M side, faults initiate at the lower M side first and then propagate to the higher M side.
%The along-ridge coupling forces (i.e. torsion (clockwise); shearing ($\sigma_{xz}$)) prevent relative displacement between the two neighbors along the ridge axis. These along ridge coupling forces on the other hand assist in fault propagation from the lower M side (M = 0.2) to the higher M side (M = 0.8) and reduces the time difference in the initiation of faulting along the ridge axis when comparing with seperated pseudo-2D models.

\end{figure}

By 52.5 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.b}), the normal fault on the right hand side of the ridge axis continues to evolve while the one on the left becomes inactive. The choice of which fault to delvelop seems to be made due to a small numerical perturbation between the two faults seen in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.a} although the model setup is symmetrical across the ridge axis. The timing difference of initiation of faulting along the ridge axis creates an offset in the $x$-axis direction between the breakaways along the ridge that the breakaway at the lower M side extends further than that of the higher M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}}). The offset is maintained because the extending velocity of the breakaways to move away from the ridge axis is controlled by the far field extension rate, $V_{x}$. The plastic strain also shows similar along ridge offset in $x$-axis direction. However, the along ridge offset in $x$-direction of the tips of the extending plastic strain reduces at $\sim$295 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}.d}) because once the detachment fault at the lower M side bends to its lowest dip angle, the termination of the detachment fault stops extending and the healing effect implemented in the model reduces quickly the plastic strain of the inactive fault interface that has been exhumed to the seafloor. While at the higher M side, the termination keeps extending and reduces the initial offset generated by the asynchronous initiation of faulting. In addition, as the fault slips, crust at the footwall bends in a clockwise rotation as illustrated by Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_8]{\ref{fig_Results4_8}}. %The neutral plane ($\sigma_{xx}=0$) is shown as the boundary between blue (compression) and pink (tension) (inset of Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.b}). 


%the fault displacement at the front side is larger than that of the back because M is lower at the front and more extension needed to be accommodated by the tectonic processes (i.e. normal faulting). \annote[XT]{Thus, the breakaway at the front extending further away from the ridge axis.}{I am not sure whether the breakaway extends further at lower M side because it should be the same. The breakaway at lower M side does extend further not because of fault slip rate difference but becauses of initiation time, at lower M side, fault begin earlier thus the breakaway begin to extend earlier and reach further, however, the rate of extending away from axis for the breakway should equal to the extension rate $V_{x}$. Thus the offset between breakaways of front and back remains constant} The termination of the detachment fault where footwall begins to be exhumed to the surface will extend further due of faster bending of the footwall at the lower M side. This will also result in a larger volume of exhumation at the lower M side than that of the higher M side. For our model that even when $M=0.2$, the detachment fault can still last for a long time \citep{Baines2008}, the exhumation rate has a upper limit of extension rate of $V_{x}$ in spite of a higher fault slip rate at lower M side.  

By 240 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.c}), the median valley further deepens and widens. The detachment fault keeps slipping and as it bends, the termination at the lower M side (M $<$ 0.3) extends $\sim$15km away from the ridge axis with the dip angle decreases to $\sim$30 $\degree$ at the root of the fault and to $\sim$0 $\degree$ at the exposed fault interface. However, for the detachment at the higher M side (especially for M $>$ 0.7), the dip angle remains high and the termination of the detachment is closer to the ridge axis. The maximum relief between the breakaway and the depressed narrow zone (trough) inside the median valley becomes larger than 1 km. In addition, $\sim$1 km wavelength corrugations begin to show up between the breakaway and termination at the lower M side (M $<$ 0.3). The wavelength of the corrugations is relatively more regular than the mullion structures (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.g}) because they share different formation mechanism as will be described in the following sections. The trough evolves from a straight line parallel to the ridge axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}.a}) to a line oblique to the ridge axis and the obliquity increases with extension (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}.b,c,d}). 

By 650 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.d}), the median valley becomes wider and deeper. The detachment fault reaches its lowest dip angle and its termination stops extending. The breakaway already moved out of the model domain.
%\annote[XT]{moved out of the model domain}{it should not, if breakaway move with 25km/yr(half spreading rate), since the distance between initial break (5km away from ridge center) and right wall of the model domain is about 25km which needs 1Myr to reach. But now is only 650 kyr. Why is it?}.
The fault slip is already larger than the thickness of the crust and the upper mantle materials are exhumed to the surface. The previous fault interface bends over and dips away from the ridge axis, producing a cylindrical OCC. A hint of the inward fault jump shows up at the higher M side (0.5 $<$ M $<$ 0.65).
%\add[XT]{Its formation will be discussed in Discussion section accompanied by the stress status analysis. }

By 790 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.e}), the hint of the inward fault jump evolves and propagates toward the higher M side (M $>$ 0.5). However, the initial detachment fault is still active and takes up most of the extension. The distance between the termination of the detachment fault and the ridge axis varies alongthe ridge that the termination at the lower M side is further away from the ridge axis.%because the detachment fault at the higher M side remains in higher dip angle due to less fault slip. %This along ridge variation produces three type 2 corrugations (it will be further explained in the next section). One has a wavelength of $\sim$6 km with an amplitude of several hundred meters. The other two are on the surface of the first corrugation with wavelengths of less than 1 km and amplitudes of several tens of meters.   

By 880 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.f}), at the higher M side (M $>$ 0.5), the hint of the inward fault jump evolves to a high angle normal fault that cut through the higher M side (M $>$ 0.5) and coexists with the initial detachment fault (shown in the inset).

 \label{fig_Results_1_Sxz}
\end{figure}

By 910 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.g}), the inward fault jump takes up all the extension at the higher M side (M $>$ 0.5) and substitues the initial detachment fault. At the higher M side, previous hanging wall becomes footwall and moves with the spreading plate to the positive $x$-axis direction, however, at the lower M side, due to the limited magma supply, the hanging wall follows the conjugate plate and moves toward the negative $x$-axis direction (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_1_velocity_field]{\ref{fig_Results_1_velocity_field}}). This opposite directions of velocities result in a dextral shear stress $\sigma_{xz}$ region at the lower M side (M $<$ 0.5) $\sim$45 $\degree$ oblique to the ridge axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_1_Sxz]{\ref{fig_Results_1_Sxz}}) and the shear stress zone produces a new trough inside the median valley that aligns with it. Combined with the previous trough, an ``X'' shape topography low is created in the model.

\subsubsection{Constant M along the ridge axis (M88ConT2 Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}})}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results1_3.eps}
  \caption{Evolution of plastic strain and surface topography of the model: M88ConT2 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}).}
 \label{fig_Results1_3}
\end{figure}   

As a comparison to the varying M models, a constant M model is run. 

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_3]{\ref{fig_Results1_3}}, model M88ConT2 pruduces a $\sim$20 km wide and 1$\sim$2 km deep median valley. It is similar to the generally observation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridges. The width and depth of the median valley is almost constant along the ridge as contrast to the varying M models. The variations of the location of the breakaway and termination along the ridge that mentioned in the reference model (M28LinT1) are not produced. Because the magma supply is constant along the ridge with M = 0.8, there is no along ridge axis variation in the rate of tensional stress accumulation. Thus, the normal faults along the ridge initiate at the same time and the slipping rate of the fault is also constant along the ridge axis. The synchronized fault initiation results in no offset between breakaways and the constant sliping rate produces no along ridge axis variation in the position of the termination. In addition, neither corrugations nor mullion structures are generated. Normal faults alternate on each side of the ridge axis with a period of $\sim$300 kyr due to the mechanism metioned in the ``Introduction'' section for the 2D models of M $>$ 0.5. This fault alternaltion produces the symmetrical high frequncy abyssal hills. For 3D models, why and how fault alternates on each side of the ridge axis is slightly different than the previous 2D studies. It will be further described in the following section. 

\subsection{Main characteristics of the models}
Six main characteristics of the models are described in this section. They are ``location of the termination'', ``geometry of the trough'', ``inward fault jump'', ``fault alternation'', ``cut-back'' and ``corrugations and mullion structures''.
\subsubsection{Location of termination}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results1_2.eps}
  \caption{Five slices of strain rate along the ridge for the model M28LinT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}) at 107.5 kyr. Terminations and breakaways along the ridge are marked by the black and red arrows respectively. }
 \label{fig_Results1_2}
\end{figure}   

The location of the termination (bold dash line (black) in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}}) of the detachment fault where footwall begins to be exhumed to the seafloor varies along the ridge. As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_2]{\ref{fig_Results1_2}}, the highest strain rate regions (red) can be interpreted as the active detachment fault interfaces. Compared to the two slices with M $>$ 0.5, the distances between terminations and the ridge axis is larger and the dip angles of the detachment faults is smaller at the lower M side (M $<=$ 0.5). For ridge region with M $>$ 0.5, fault root is pushed away from the ridge axis due to excessive diking and the termination is closer to the ridge axis due to later initiation of the fault and thus the dip angle is higher because the distance between the termination and the fault root is smaller. For ridge region with M $<=$ 0.5, the distances and the dip angles are similar. Because although the rate of fault slip is higher for lower M, the rotation rate of the detachment fault interface is determined by how fast the termination extends away from the fault root. Since the extending rate of the termination has a maximum value that is restricted by the far field extension rate $V_{x}$ and the detachment fault roots at the same place at the intersection between the center dike and the brittle-ductile transition (BDT), the bending rate of the detachment fault is similar among the three slices of M $<=$ 0.5.  %In other words, in order to spend least frictional energy during faulting, the detachment fault interface between the two ends (termination and fault root) tends to be a straight line.     Thus, the dip angle of the detachment fault is inversely proportional to the distance between the termination and the root of the fault when M $<$ 0.5. Since the breakaways at the lower M side (M $<$ 0.5) moves with the extending plate under the same velocity $V_{x}$, and the initiation time difference of the normal faults at the lower M side is similar (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.a}), the distances between the breakaways and the roots of the faults are the same. Meanwhile, the distance between breakaways and terminations as indicated by the red and black arrows in the Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_2]{\ref{fig_Results1_2}} is similar along the ridge axis. Thus the dip angles of the faults at the same time along the ridge-axis are very much the same. However, when M $>$ 0.5 (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_2]{\ref{fig_Results1_2}, (M = 0.65, 0.8)}), the amount of fault slip decreases as M increases. The crust at the footwall experiences less bending and the detachment fault remains in a higher angle as well as that the terminations are closer to the ridge axis. Because the root of the fault is slowly pushed away from ridge axis while the breakaways of the faults are closer to ridge axis due to a later initiation of the fault. In addition, the crust thickness that the fault cuts through is slowly increasing as the fault being pushed away from ridge center due to excessive diking. These three factors together contribute to a higher dip angle. In a unit time, the volume of the exhumation is also smaller for the higher M side.
One thing needs to be noted is that the trough at the higher M side correspond to the terminations but detached from the terminations at the low M side (M $<$ 0.5) as shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_2]{\ref{fig_Results1_2}}.

\subsubsection{Geometry of the trough}
%\subsubsection{Shear low (M28LinT1)}

The depressed narrow region inside the median valley is termed as ``trough''. It evolves from a straight line parallel to the ridge-axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}.a}) to a line oblique to the ridge-axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}.b,c,d}) for model M28LinT1. Initially, the trough corresponds to the termination of the detachment fault. Due to the coupling along the ridge axis, fault propagates from front to back in almost a straight line parallel to the ridge axis. However, as the detachment fault bends at the lower M side, the trough is detached from the termination and due to lower magma supply, the trough at the lower M side is pulled to the conjugate plate to the negative $x$-axis direction. While the trough at the higher M side (M $>$ 0.5) are pushed away from the ridge axis by the excessive diking. However, since the trough cannot bypass the termination, the trough at M = 0.8 is restricted at the termination. Together it generates the curved trough (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_4]{\ref{fig_Results1_4}.b,d}). 
%{Important tecnique from discussion on Mar. 9th with Eunseo: 1. One way to analyze models is to make hypothesis to describe model behaviors and than use models to approve or reject it. If rejected, find a new hypothesis and do the same thing again.}
%\add[XT]{4. An new thinking on little termination or dip angle variation when M$<0.5$ as observed in %figure~\ref{fig_Results1_2}: why along-z hanging wall has little variation is because we have along z coupling, the rotational shear failure between along-z neighbors are so hard. and also, the more extension in M0.2 end is accommodated elastically by the whole plate to the left of the detachment fault which can be observed as lower topo(topography variation along ridge axis).} 
%\add[XT]{One question needs to be answered: at 410 timesteps (205kyr), the breakaway at the front already extends 15km. If assumming a constant extending rate, it means a velocity of around 75km/Myr, much faster than half spreading rate 25km/Myr. If it is true, I need to change previous discussion on how fast breakaway being pulled away from ridge-axis.}


\subsubsection{Inward fault jump}
The inward fault jump is another common characteristic of the models. As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}}, at the region with M $>$ 0.5, the existing normal fault is pushed away from the ridge-axis due to excessive diking (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_1]{\ref{fig_Results1_1}.c,d}). As it moves away from the ridge axis, the frictional energy for the fault, the bending energy for the foot wall as well as the gravity that resists the exhumation of the foot wall increase [\citealp{Lavier2000, Olive2014}]. The initail detachment fault remains active until the negative works reach an upper limit that breaking a new fault near the ridge axis needs less work than to maintain the initial one, the initial detachment fault at the higher M side is substituted by the inward jumping fault. This inward jumping behavior of the normal fault is termed as ``inward fault jump''. As the fault evolves, it connects to the initial detachment at the lower M side (M $<$ 0.5) and generates a curved termination along the ridge. Compared to fault alternation, it forms at the same side of the ridge axis and its length is consistent with the region along the ridge axis where M $>$ 0.5 rather than cut through the whole MOR segment.
\subsubsection{Fault alternation}
As shown in M88ConT2 (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results1_3]{\ref{fig_Results1_3}}), the normal fault first evolves on the left hand side of the ridge axis and produces an abyssal hill parallel to the ridge axis. By 480 kyr, another normal fault evolves on the other side of the ridge axis and takes the place of the first one. This behavior of alternatively normal faulting on each side of the ridge axis is termed as ``fault alternation''. Among the 12 models (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}), only three models produces fault alternation. They are M88ConT2, M58SinT2 and M58SqrtT2. Fault alternates only when weakening rate is low (type 2 weakening) and the average integration of M along the ridge is larger than 0.65. Analysis on when and why fault alternates is given in ``Discussion'' section.

\subsubsection{Cut-back}

\end{figure}   

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results4_4_sqrt_cut_back_with_time.eps}
  \caption{M28SqrtT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}). Cut back behaviors in square root functional form model with different time.}
 \label{fig_Results4_4}
\end{figure}   

Cut-back is another common feature observed in the models. It happens most frequently in the square root models. When the tip of the weak fault interface extends with the plate extension and is intersected by a pre-exisitng shear stress $\sigma_{xy}$ (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_5]{\ref{fig_Results4_5}}), the extra shear stress cuts the tip of the weak fault interface and leads to the decoupling between the spreading plate and the upper layer of the hanging wall of the detachment fault. Under the gravity, the decoupled upper layer of the hanging wall then recedes backward to the ridge axis with a very fast velocity following the topography slope similar to the mass wasting (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_3_2_5_Cut-back_velocity]{\ref{fig_Results_3_2_5_Cut-back_velocity}}).

Four factors together trigger the cut-back. The unbending of the bent footwall; the pre-existing shear stress that add extra cutting force to the weak tip; the shear stress that aligns to the detachment fault interface; the along ridge shear due to M variation.

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_8]{\ref{fig_Results4_8}}, due to bending of the crust at the footwall side, below the blue neutral plane, $\sigma_{xx}>0$, meaning tensional stress increases as fault slips. The resulting force tends to unbend the bent crust and drag down the connecting surface (the future decoupled hanging wall).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results4_6_sqrt_cut_back_bending_drop.eps}
  \caption{M28SqrtT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}). Bending stress drop in the crust close to dike due to cut back behavior.}
 \label{fig_Results4_6}
\end{figure}

In the Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}}, the hanging wall recedes backward to the ridge axis with a high velocity (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.b,e (velocity)}) accompanied with a sudden topography drop (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.b) compared to c); d) compared to e) (in the second row)}). The cut back also produces a continuous high angle fault scarp with a relief of $\sim$ 1 km aligns to the initial breakaway and extends for about 20 km in length (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.e (second row: topography)}). Its distance to the central dike varies along the ridge axis.

During the cut back process, the tensional stress due to bending is released at the lower M side (0.2 $<$ M $<$ 0.57) in the left tip of the bent crust (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_6]{\ref{fig_Results4_6}.a compared to b}), however, at the higher M side, the tensional bending stress keeps increasing due to the far field extension (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_6]{\ref{fig_Results4_6}.c compared to d}). This behavior assists in the decouple between lower and higher M side hanging walls. 

Once the cut back happens at 162.5kyr, the $\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xz}$ and $\sigma_{xx}$ are released (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.e (fourth and fifth row: $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$)}). After the cut back, the termination of the detachment fault recedes backwards for about 7 kilometer towards the ridge axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.f (third row: plastic strain)}).% (termination fronts are always consistent with tension stresses in $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ as well as with plastic strain front(due to healing, high plastic strain region corresponds only to region with continuously deformation) (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_1}} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_2]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_2}})).
This behavior helps maintain a high angle normal fault. In addition, $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$ soon fill in the area between cut back created fault scarp and the new termination (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.f (fourth and fifth row: $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$)} because $\sigma_{xy}$ always accummulates immediately beneath the normal fault interface and the red $\sigma_{xz}$ left to the new termination is due to the along ridge-axis variatioin in the rate of fault slip (low M side larger).  

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results4_9_sqrt_cut_back_new_fault_chase.eps}
  \caption{M28SqrtT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}). New fault front chase after initial abandoned breakaway.}
 \label{fig_Results4_9}
\end{figure}

There is one phenomenon very interesting and counter-intuitive that worth describing here. After the cut back, and termination retreat, the termination front at the higher M side extends faster and further than the lower M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_9]{\ref{fig_Results4_9}}). This is partly related to the unbending decouple phenomenon we described ealier that the tensional stress are released at the lower M side but continues to accummulates at the higher M side during the cut back unbending. Since the tensional stress is released at the lower M side, it needs time to accummulate to where it was and then starts from there to drag the new near ridge axis fault away from the ridge axis. While at the higher M side the increasing tensional stress directly leads to a fast extending fault front. Thus creates the behavior. \add[XT]{One question is, how to explain that the fault front is moving much faster than the initial abandoned breakaway? New fault front soon reach the old breakaway.} This phenomenon is responsible for the corrugations observed. It create an ``X'' shape ``scan'' that first ``scan'' the topography with faster low M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.d and e}) and then with faster high M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_9]{\ref{fig_Results4_9}.c and d}). This results in curved terminations with hundred-to-thoudand meters wavelengths that directly create parallel to spreading direction mullion structures.

\end{figure}

In addition, the higher $\sigma_{xx}$ in the median valley of conjugate plate at low M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_7]{\ref{fig_Results4_7}}) is due to the brittle crust is thinnest at the median valley, thus when same amount of force propagates from far field extension to the center median valley, the stress will increases.

\subsection{Effects of the functional forms of M variation}
As shown in the \annote[EC]{tables}{which table? Specify.}, \add[EC]{the models with} \annote[EC]{M28}{Before starting to use this notation, define and explain it first!} with type 1 weakening is \annote[EC]{the only M range that has three functional forms data points available}{This sentence gives an impression that you didn't want to use these three but had no choice but to. This is not the case, I belive. Probably you'd want to point out that one of these three is the reference model that has been fully described earlier. So, we are in a better position to compare it with similar models with different functional forms. In fact, I think this introductory sentence can be thrown out.} 

\change[EC]{There are two phenomena that show distinct differences with respect to different functional forms.}{By comparing M28LinT1 with M28SinT1 and M28sqrtT1, I identified two main characteristics in the different behaviors of these models due to different functional forms of M variation.} One is the geometry and timing of the secondary fault. The other is the ``Cut back'' behavior. \annote[EC]{mostly observed in the square root model.}{No need to spill the beans.}

 \label{fig_Results3_1}
\end{figure}   

\paragraph{Second Fault}\label{para_SecondaryFault}

For the linear functional form, the second fault \note[XT]{add a definition of secondary fault in the begining, here add a link of figure about primary and sec fault, enlarge the second fault and add label in the figure and use it here } at the high M side has started accommodating most of the extension at around 900 kyr and the initial detachment becomes inactive \note[XT]{(Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_2]{\ref{fig_Results4_2}})}{refer to Figure 8.f is better}. It nucleates from the ridge center where M$=0.5$ and then propagates to the M$=0.8$ end. %(Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results3_1]{\ref{fig_Results3_1}} where the red line begin to exceeds 0.5 at Z$=10$).
 %This secondary fault creates another dome with initial composition likely to be volcanic rather than ultramafic, however, as it evolves, if it can last long enough to cut through the whole crust, mantle materials might exhume to the surface. The composition of the domes observed at Kane magamullions is similar to this mechanism between ultramafic babel dome and eastern to it the crustal inside-corner high.  its spatial distribution is at M$>0.5$ region.

 \label{fig_Results4_2}
\end{figure}   

For the sinusoidal form, the second fault begins to form at a much earlier time around 550 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_2]{\ref{fig_Results4_2}}). The sinusoidal form consistently has higher M values than the linear form (Fig. 10), implying a greater amount of magma supply. %The total force to push the hanging wall of the detachment away from the dike is greater than that of linear. The larger the force,
The first forming fault moves away from the ridge axis faster and locks earlier in the case of the sinusoidal form. As a result, the second fault appears earlier than in the case of the linear M variation. In addition, the sinusoidal form produces the second fault with a greater along-strike dimension than the linear form because this length is proportional to the length of the M $\ge$ 0.5 portion of the ridge (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results3_1]{\ref{fig_Results3_1}}). 
For square root, there is no secondary fault forming because the ``cut back'' behavior releases the tensional stress in the hanging wall.

\paragraph{Cut-back}\label{para_CutBack}

\note[XT]{Define a cut-back and think about a different name.}
The cut-back characterizes but are not limited to the models with the square root form of M variation.\note[XT]{exclusively about the square root models?} As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_1}}, Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_2}} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}} \note[XT]{Bring up Fig. 26 here and incude only the cut-back panel.}, between 97.5 kyr and 100 kyr, there are cut-backs in the square root model M28SqrtT1 at the low M side where hanging walls with surface area of $\sim$ 60 km$^{2}$ and $\sim$ 120 km$^{2}$ (the red block) suddenly rebound backwards towards the ridge axis as seen in 100 kyr and 160 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_3_1]{\ref{fig_Results4_3_2}.a} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.d,e,f}), along with sudden topography drop (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.d,e} 2nd row), $\sigma_{xy}$ and $\sigma_{xz}$ released, termination falls back (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results4_4]{\ref{fig_Results4_4}.f} 3rd row). 

\subsection{Effects of the weakening rate}

According to our available twelve 3D models, we have three pairs of models that both have type 1 and type 2 \note[XT]{might want to add a ref to the section defining these.} weakening while the range of M and functional form are maintained to be the same. They are M57SinT1/T2, M58SinT1/T2 and M58SqrtT1/T2.

\paragraph{M57SinT1 versus M57SinT2}

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results_Weakening_2_M57SinT1VST2_CutbackVSsecondaryFault.eps}
 \caption{M57SinT2 versus M57SinT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}). a) and b) are for M57SinT2, c) and d) are for M57SinT1.}
\label{fig_Results_Weakenging_2}
\end{figure}

Initially, both models develop normal faults on both sides of the ridge axis\note[XT]{no hyphen in ``ridge axis''.} at the low M side. In the model with the faster weakening rate (M57SinT1), faults propagate toward the high M side and cut through the whole crust by 25 kyr but this process completes later at 50 kyr in the model with the slower weakening rate (M57SinT2). At around 310 kyr, the second fault appears at the high M side\note[XT]{instead of z=5, use a M value.} of M57SinT2 while where M $<=$\annote[XT]{5}{some M value}, the initial fault remains active (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_2]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_2}.a) and b)}). However, when the weakening is fast (M57SinT1), cut-back happens at around 260 kyr and help to maintain a high angle fault with closer to ridge axis termination. The initial fault remains, no secondary fault forming (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_2]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_2}.a) and b)}). In addition, the width of median valley at low M side is wider for M57SinT2 than M57SinT1 (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_2]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_2}.a) and b) versus c) and d)}) due to slower weakening (type 2) alows a more distributed tensional stress $\sigma_{xx}$ rather than fast weakening that once a fault is established, larger amount of tensional stress $\sigma_{xx}$ will be released at the fault.

\label{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{M57SinT1}\label{para_M57SinT1}

For M57SinT1, as shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_3]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}}, at 400 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_3]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}.a}), there is a antithetic fault forming at the low M side accommodating part of the extension, which results in a curved termination at the far frontier. As it evolve (530 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_3]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}.b})), the termination at the low M side further recedes backward while the termination at the center (Z$=11\sim13$) extends further. This curved termination leads to a curved topography (white curve in the second row). As the fault evolves and bends further away from the axis, at the time of 740 kyr, another antithetic fault forming again at the low M side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_3]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}.c}). It doesn't take the place of initial fault and disapear soon, however, it again releases tensional stress and results in that the termination at far front recedes backward. At 1000 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_3]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}.d}), an Atlantiss Massif shape OCC is produced (low M side (lower magma supply) has a wider dome and high M side (higher magma supply) has a narrower dome) due to the along ridge axis termination evolution. Corrugations with wavelength varying from hundreds to kilometers are also created.

\label{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{M57SinT2}\label{para_M57SinT2}

For M57SinT2, as shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_4]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}}, instead of maintaining one fault all the time for M57SinT1, it creats secondary fault at high M side with different mechanism several times. A secondary fault is created at 325 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_4]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}.a}), when a new near axis normal fault take the place of the initial one at high M side. Between 447.5 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_4]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}.b}) and 450 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_4]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}.c}), termination falls back, and as it evolve, termination at the high M side extends further at 600 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_4]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}.d}). At 885 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_4]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_4}.e}), a secondary fault propagates from low Z to high Z and terminates the further extended fault at high Z and maintain a near ridge axis termination.

\subsubsection{M58SinT1 versus M58SinT2}

A major difference between M58SinT1 and M58SinT2 is that M58SinT1 keep faulting at one side of the ridge axis while M58SinT2's fault alternates.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results_Weakening_5_M58SinT1_time_evolution.eps}
 \caption{M58SinT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}) faulting and stress evolution with respect to time.}
\label{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{M58SinT1}\label{para_M58SinT1}

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}}, in 1Myr, the fault keeps on the right hand side of the ridge axis. It evolves dynamically. Between 240 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.a}) and 245 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.b}), there is a cut back. At 345 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.c}), at low Z side, there are two offsetted antithetic faults (Z=$1\sim2$ and Z=$5\sim9$) in the hanging wall begin to evolve and soon connect to each other forming anastomosing fault zone. At 390 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.d}), the new near axis anastomosing fault zone replace the old further away from ridge axis detachment. There is dextral $\sigma_{xz}$ forming on the right hand side of the new anastomosing fault zone ((Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.d}), row 5) due to the offset between the new near axis fault at low Z side and extended further fault at high Z side and leads to the development of a $\sim45\degree$ shear zone connection between the new near axis fault zone at low Z side and the further away from axis original detachment at high Z side. It also creates a curved termination which will lead to a curved topography (boundary between blue and white) seen at 530 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.e}). Note that this curved termination can be a mechanism for producing large wavelength (several kilometers) undulating corrugations. Between 530 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.e}) and 550 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.f}), there is another cut back happens. Terminations fall backwards to near ridge axis position. At 580 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.g}), at the high Z side, a new near rigde-axis high angle normal fault begin to initiate under the assistance of rotational force from low Z side due to along ridge axis coupling. This produces a large rider block with several kilometers in its length scale. Previous ``S'' curved termination now evolves to a half circle curve and it soon affects the curve of topography as seen at 850 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.h}). Due to along ridge axis variation in diking, a large sinistral shear zone (red region $\sim40\degree$ oblique to ridge axis seen in 5th row of 960 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.i})) keep developing and cut the circle curved fault zone at 850 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.h}) into a new fault zone with higher curvature as seen in 1000 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}.j}).

\end{figure}

\paragraph{M58SinT2}\label{para_M58SinT2}

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_6]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_6}}, the fault initiates on the left hand side of the ridge axis (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_6]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_6}.a}). Low Z side extends further than high Z side. It takes around 100 kyr to form into a localized fault plane due to slower rate of weakening. At 215 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_6]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_6}.b}), another fault on the conjugate plate begin to evolve and replaces the initial one. As seen from (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_6]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_6}.b}), corrugations are created at low Z side. At 330 kyr, a third fault forming at the left hand side of the ridge axis. Between 490 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_6]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_6}.d}) and 495 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_6]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_6}.e}), there is a cut back.

\subsubsection{M58SqrtT1 versus M58SqrtT2}
The major difference between M58SqrtT1 and M58SqrtT2 is also whether the normal fault alternates or not.

\paragraph{M58SqrtT1}\label{para_M58SqrtT1}

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}}, initially, there is a 5 element offset between breakaways along the ridge axis due to along ridge axis variation in diking (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.a}). At 370 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.b}), there is a vertical tensile failure at Z$=1\sim2$. Two parallel dextral (blue) shear regions are seen (5th row). The low Z shear zone assists in the shear failure observed at 400 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.c}), and it develops into near ridge axis normal fault (Z=$4\sim12$) and propagates to high Z side which eventually cuts through and reaches Z$=20$ and replaces the initial extended fault at high Z side at 460 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.d}). The vertical tensile failure zone at Z$=1\sim3$ (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.d} 3rd row) begin to evolve and assists in the initiation of a new near ridge axis high angle normal fault which connect with the fault at the high Z side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.e}) at 590 kyr. At 660 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.f} 3rd row), there is a hint of high angle normal faulting at Z$=1\sim3$ of conjugate plate. But it doesn't develop. At 730 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.g} 5th row), a dextral (blue) shear zone at the low Z side help to create the faulting pattern seen at 780 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.h} 3rd row), a concave termination with a wavelenth of 10 kilometers and it has the potential to create a large wavelength corrugation. Meanwhile, at the low Z side, near the ridge axis, there is a antithetic fault forming at the hanging wall of the detachment and it later propagates to high Z side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.i}). From 820 kyr to 880 kyr, the antithetic fault evolves to near ridge axis normal fault and connects with the detachment at the high Z side (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_7]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_7}.j}). In addition, a tensile failure shows its hint at the low Z side (Z$=1\sim5$) of the conjugate plate.

\label{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}}, at 195 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}.a}), due to transtensional stress at low Z side (Z$=1\sim6$), several corrugations begin to evolve. At conjugate plate, dipping toward axis shear zone $\sigma_{xy}$ (red at 4th row) show its curve and keeps accumulating. $\sigma_{xx}$ is also accummulating on the conjugate plate. Between 195 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}.a}) and 200 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}.b}), there is a cut back. At 270 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}.c}), immediately above and following the curved shape shear $\sigma_{xy}$ zone on the left hand side of the ridge axis, a new fault begin to evolve and replace the initial fault on the right. At 330 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}.d}), at the low Z side, a new near axis high angle normal fault take the place of initial further away from ridge axis fault partly due to rotational force from along ridge coupling. At 460 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}.e}), another normal fault begin to evolve on the right hand side of the ridge axis.

\subsection{Effects of the range of M variation}
So far, we have three ranges for M variations along the ridge axis (M28, M57 and M58) with same segment length of 20km. Among the 12 available models, two M58 models and the constant M$=0.8$ model with type 2 weakening produce fault alternation while others do not. Generally, M57 and M58 models create a median valley much narrower and shallower than that of M28 models. $\frac{dM}{dz}$ is larger for M28 than M58 and M57.

\subsubsection{M28SinT1 versus M57SinT1 versus M58SinT1}

\paragraph{M57SinT1 versus M58SinT1}\label{M57SinT1 versus M58SinT1}

For description of M57SinT1 evolution with respect to time, please refer to Section~\hyperref[para_M57SinT1]{\ref{para_M57SinT1}} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_3]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_3}}. For description of M58SinT1 evolution with respect to time, please refer to  Section~\hyperref[para_M58SinT1]{\ref{para_M58SinT1}} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_5]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_5}}. Comparing M57SinT1 and M58SinT1, the major difference is that the faulting pattern evolution for M58SinT1 is much more dynamic with a higher frequency of secondary faults, cut back and offseted fault segments connection. For M58SinT1, the new secondary near ridge axis normal or antithetic faults usually replace the existed one. However, for M57SinT1, diking is not strong enough to create big enough stress perturbation along the ridge axis for secondary or antithetic faults to take the place of the original one. At the low Z side, near ridge axis antithetic fault only helps to accommodate tensional stress which help maintain a high angle normal fault with near to ridge axis termination while the termination at the high Z side gradually move off axis. This creates a OCC with larger dome at lower magma supply side than that of higher magma supply side which is opposite to the shape of OCC created by M58SinT1. 

\paragraph{M28SinT1}\label{para_M28SinT1}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./Figures/fig_Results_MRange_1_M28SinT1_time_evolution.eps}
 \caption{M28SinT1 (Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}) faulting and stress evolution with respect to time.}
\label{fig_Results_MRange_1}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_1]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_1}}, faulting evolution is much less dynamic than that of M58SinT1. Faulting keeps on the right hand side of the ridge axis. Only one secondary fault is formed at around 540 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_1]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_1}.d}). Initially, at 100 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_1]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_1}.a}), at the low Z side, the normal shear zone at conjugate plate takes up part of the extension and leave a dent in the topography. But it doesn't last long. The initial breakaway of the detachment extends further away from ridge axis with four elements in along ridge axis offset at 250 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_1]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_1}.b}). At 420 kyr, at the high Z side, a hint of new near ridge axis high angle normal fault begin to show up. It delvelop into a secondary fault at 540 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_1]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_1}.d}) and propagates toward high Z side. This results in a sinistral shear zone (red region in 5th row). At the low Z side (Z$=1\sim3$), a tensile failure can be seen and it take up part of the extension at the low Z side which results in the recede of termination at the low Z side as seen at 800 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_1]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_1}.e}) while the termination at higher Z side extends further away from the ridge axis.

A major difference is that M57SinT2 does not create alternating normal faults on each side of the ridge axis while M58SinT2 does. \add[XT]{Why this seemingly small change could lead to such a to the first order difference in model behaviors?}

As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}}, between 160 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.a}) and 162.5 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.b}), there is a cut back. The corrugation is very severe and have a discrete distribution with one element width as its wavelength. The frontier of breakaway also shows discrete distribution of $\sigma_{xx}$ and $\sigma{zz}$ alternating between tension and compression which might be the reason for the undulating topography. At 350 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.c} 3rd row), the two offsetted red line indicates tensile failure at the termination and the shorter one at the high Z side helps maintain a near ridge axis high angle normal fault. At 430 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.d}), the presence of vertical tensile failure near the ridge axis at the low Z side is responsible for the recede of the front of the plastic strain at Z$=1\sim3$. While at Z=$5\sim10$, the breakaway keeps extending further away from the ridge axis. This curved front results in a curved topography as seen in 640 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.e}) and is also responsible for the large dextral shear (blue) zone (5th row). At 705 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.f}), a new near ridge axis secondary fault begin to evolve and replace the original one at high Z side with a length of $\sim15$ kilometers. The secondary fault also connect with the further away from ridge axis original fault at low Z side. The topography at 1000 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_2]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_2}.h}) is a result of the curved and later connected fault. The frontier of the plastic strain at high Z side soon catch up with that at the low Z side due to the presence of a tensile failure zone a the low Z side that has taken up part of the extension.

\subsubsection{M57SqrtT2 versus M58SqrtT2}

For description of M58SqrtT2 evolution with respect to time, please refer to Paragraph~\hyperref[para_M58SqrtT2]{\ref{para_M58SqrtT2}} and Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_Weakenging_8]{\ref{fig_Results_Weakenging_8}}.

The major difference between M57SqrtT2 and M58SqrtT2 is that M57SqrtT2 keeps faulting at the same side of the ridge axis while M58SqrtT2 alternates.

\label{fig_Results_MRange_3}
\end{figure}

For M57SqrtT2, there are totally six small scale cut back happen at 282.5 kyr, 290 kyr, 365 kyr, 452.5 kyr, 482.5 kyr and 540 kyr respectively (the model stops at 540 kyr). As shown in Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}}, the fault keeps on the left hand side of the ridge axis. At 200 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.b}), a new near ridge axis high angle normal fault begin to evolve and take the place of the initial one. As the fault evolve, a transient stage of discontinuous abyssal hill is produced at the low Z side as seen at 225 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.c}). The fault propagate toward high Z side and cut through the plate at $\sim$245 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.d}) when sawtooth shape topography at the low Z side (2nd row) is created by sawtooth shape $\sigma_{xx}$ (6th row) and $\sigma_{zz}$ (7th row). Between 365 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.e}) and 367.5 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.f}), there is a cut back. At 490 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.g}), there is new near ridge axis antithetic fault on the hanging wall which terminates the old fault and develops into a vertical near ridge axis tensile failure as seen at 540 kyr (Figure~\hyperref[fig_Results_MRange_3]{\ref{fig_Results_MRange_3}.h}).


\subsection{Summary of Results}
There are several behaviors that are controlled by the model parameters. Generally, only M58 models with type 2 weakening produce aternating faults on both side of the ridge axis. All the models show corrugations. As for faulting patterns in terms of evolution frequency, usually Square root is more dynamic than Sinusoidal than Linear, M58 is more dynamic than M57 than M28.

Following tables are a summery of the model behaviors with respect to different setup parameters.
