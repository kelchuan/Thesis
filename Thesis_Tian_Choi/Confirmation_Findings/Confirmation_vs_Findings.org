*  Findings 
1.1 and 1.2 need field evidences. 
**  Along ridge coupling for reconciling discrepancy between 2D model M(0.3~0.5) and field observation.
**  Asynchronous faulting induced isochron-parallel tensile failure as a mechanism for corrugations.

**  From major features
Comparing model results and field observation can help to infer historical tectonics and magmatism evolution.
***  mass wasting
***  hourglass median valley
*  Confirmation
**  Average M = 0.6425 for separating abyssal hills and OCC formation.
This is first mentioned by [Buck et al., 2005] in 2D version, we confirm that when M increase, faulting begin to alternate. 
We update on: first, it is 3D version average M for varying M along the ridge; Second, it is very sensitive to weakening rate because only type 2 (slower) weakening results in fault alternation. Further investigation needed to be done on different functional forms, ranges of M variations and different weakening rates. 
**  From major features
***  Inward fault jump
First mentioned by [Tucholke et al., 1998], but first time 3D modeling. It provide an explanation for brother domes.
***  Mullion structure
     Due to Anastomosing (Smith et al., 2014) or continuous casting model (Spencer, 1999). Still first time in 3D modeling.
