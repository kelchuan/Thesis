\textbf{\textit{\large{Dedication}}}
\end{center}

I would like to dedicate this thesis to my mother, Tian, Xia (\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}田霞\end{CJK}). I wouldn't have a chance to experience this wonderful world without her giving birth to me. She rears me up by herself with her great love, optimism and peseverence. Without her guidance and support, I would not become who I am.

I also want to dedicate this thesis toward my thesis advisor: Professor Eunseo Choi. His mentorship defines what a great advisor is like. Without his guidance, neither this thesis nor my fast personal development during these two years is possible. He has kindled a flame that illuminates the way for my future career as a geodynamic modeler.
