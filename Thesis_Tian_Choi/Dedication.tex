\textbf{\textit{Dedication}}
\end{center}

I would like to dedicate this thesis to my mother, Xia Tian. I wouldn't have a chance to experience this wonderful world without her giving birth to me. She rears me up by herself with her great love, optimism and peseverence. Without her guidance and support, I will not become who I am.

I also want to dedicate this thesis toward my major thesis advisor: Dr. Eunseo Choi. His mentorship defines what a great advisor is like. Without his  guidance, neither this theis nor my large self-development during these two years is possible. He has kindled a flame that illuminates the way for my future career as a geodynamic modeler.
