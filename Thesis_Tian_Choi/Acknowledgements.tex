\textbf{\textit{Acknowledgements}}
\end{center}

There is no proper words for me to express my deep gratitude toward my thesis advisor Dr. Eunseo Choi. He has changed my life in a very positive way. From him, I have learned what a great researcher and educator should be like. It is because of his unfailing care and understanding that have given me the courage to persevere, to carry on during the darkest days as an international student far away from home. It is his vivid and interesting lessons that have inspired me so much that I want to devote my career into geodynamic modeling. It is his numerous inspiration and encouragement that has motivated me to work super hard (enjoy in the same time) on the hard problems. It is his altruistic share that has provided me with great chances to learn from great researchers, references, and to attend meetings. It is his patience to guide me through my endless silly questions that has led me to an independent researcher. Blessings from Eunseo, my role model, are countless. I will keep them in mind and try my best to relay the torch.
