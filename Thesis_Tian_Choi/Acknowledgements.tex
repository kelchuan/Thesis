\textbf{\textit{Acknowledgements}}

There is no proper words for me to express my deep gratitude toward my thesis advisor, Professor Eunseo Choi. He has changed my life in a very positive way. From him, I have learned what a great researcher and educator should be like. It is because of his unfailing care and understanding that have given me the courage to persevere, and to carry on during the darkest days as an international student far away from home. It is his vivid and interesting lessons that have inspired me so much that I want to devote my career into geodynamic modeling. It is his numerous inspiration and encouragement that has motivated me to work super hard (enjoy at the same time) on the fascinating research questions. It is his altruistic share that has provided me with great chances to learn from great researchers, references, and to attend meetings. It is his patience to guide me through my endless silly questions that has nurished and cultivated my capabilities of being an independent researcher. Blessings from Eunseo, my role model, are countless. I will keep them in mind and try my best to relay the torch.

I would also like to thank members of my thesis committee, Professor Christine Powell and Professor Jer-Ming Chiu, for their guidance and support. Especially I want to thank Dr. Chiu for his sharing and advice on my course term projects and for his patience to answer all my silly questions. In addition, I want to thank Dr. Powell for your warmhearted encouragement and benevolence during my studies at the Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI).

\\
I am also grateful to the courses instructors for many vivid and interesting courses that have stimulated my interests in Geophysics, helped me build up my foundation and expanded my horizon in the field. They are Professor Robert Smalley for ``Data Analysis in Geophysics'', Professor Charles Langston for ``Global Seismology'' and ``Inverse Methods in Geophysics'', Professor Mitch Withers for ``Signal Processing in Earth Science'', Professor Eunseo Choi for ``Global Geophysics'' and ``Geodynamics'', Professor Christine Powell for ``Evironmental Geophysics'', Professor Randy Cox for ``Art of Earth Science'', Professor Jer-Ming Chiu for ``Exploration Seismology''. Thank you so much. Especially, I want to thank Professor Withers for you encouragement and your time and efforts for answering all my questions. I would also like to thank Professor Eric Daub for your delicious homemade cakes provdided to our graduate students every Wednesday during the ``CERI Discussion''. I am probably the person who ate most of them and enjoyed the most.
