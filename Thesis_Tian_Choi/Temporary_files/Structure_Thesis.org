* Introduction
** Research Questions
** Review of Literature
** Statement of Research Purpose
** Findings
* Methods
** Method of approach
** Model Setup
** Parameters to control
** Table of run models
* Results (Direct observation without much logical reasoning, more objective)
** Reference model
*** Constant M88
** Main characteristics of the models (order from most frequently happen behavior)
*** Second Fault
*** Cut-Back
*** Corrugation
**** Corrugation due to anastomosing
**** Corrugation due to asynchronous in faulting

*** Location of termination (M28LinT1)
*** geometry of trough(find a term for it or define myself) (M28LinT1)

*** Fault Alternation (? better name of it (ask brian, trevor))
**** Trade-off between bending and weakening
**** Alternating on conjugate plate
**** Effect of along ridge-axis couplin
** Influence of weakening rate
** Variation of the functional form
** Variation of the range of M
* Discussion (Can include many logical reasoning and discussion on the results with including other people work and your reasoning)
** Summary of Results

** Comparing model results with nature observation
*** Cut-back
*** Corrugations
** Influence of healing
** Model Limitation
** Recommendation for Future Research
* Conclusion (an abstract of the Abstract)(Basically, I did this, I found that.)
Only describe the finding. dif to abstract that abs is about the whole work with motivation ....

I did this, I found that.
