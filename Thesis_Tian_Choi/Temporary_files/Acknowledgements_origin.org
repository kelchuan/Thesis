* Eunseo
There is no proper words for me to express my deep gratitude toward my thesis advisor Dr. Eunseo Choi. He has changed my life in a very positive way. He not only shows me what defines a great researcher and educator but also acts like a kind father that cares about a international student that is far away from home. Countless times, whenever I come to his office with confusion, he will always patiently teach me and share with me altruistically those great references that can help me to better understand the subject. Discussing results and learning from his way of thinking has been my happiest times during this two year studies in the United States. His courses, Geodynamics and Global Geophysics has stimulate my pure interests toward the field.
