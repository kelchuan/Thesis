* 1. INTRODUCTION (x)
This preparation guide specifies Graduate School requirements pertaining to style, organization, and formatting for electronic theses and dissertations. Students should become familiar with this guide at the time they begin the first draft of their thesis or dissertation.

Students are encouraged to use publications within their discipline (i.e., refereed journals) for help with formatting author reference citations, setting up bibliographic form and content, tables and figures, the use of numbers and mathematical equations, etc. In addition, academic departments may have additional formatting requirements or may specify requirements.

*Requirements set forth in this guide take precedence over certain requirements in style manuals or refereed journals.*

* 2. POLICIES (double check 2.5.1)
** 2.1 Continuous Enrollment (x)
The continuous enrollment policy applies to all students writing a master's thesis or a doctoral dissertation. Students must be enrolled in thesis or dissertation credit for each Fall and Spring semester until the document is complete. Once students have enrolled in the maximum number of hours allowed, they may continue to enroll in one additional hour. Students planning to defend during the summer semester must also be enrolled in thesis or dissertation credit. Failure to register will result in the student being charged tuition for each semester he/she did not enroll, along with applicable late registration fees.

The only exception to this policy is if the student's major professor is on leave or otherwise unavailable. In such cases, the approval of the appropriate college director of graduate studies and the Dean of the Graduate School is required. In case of serious medical circumstances, students may request a leave of absence, subject to the approval of the program graduate studies coordinator, the college director of graduate studies, and the Dean of the Graduate School. Retroactive approval will not be granted. A leave of absence does not extend the time limitations for a degree program.
** 2.2 Thesis/Dissertation Faculty Committees (x)
Before undertaking any work on your document, a faculty committee must be formed, and the Graduate School must be notified of said committee (minimum of three members for a master's thesis committee; minimum of four members for a doctoral dissertation committee). It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all committee members are current members of the graduate faculty.  Students should not defend their final document until all faculty members, whether on campus or outside the university, have been granted graduate faculty status. (Click here for a current listing of all graduate faculty members). 
The University of Memphis maintains six levels of graduate faculty: full, associate, affiliate, adjunct, research co-mentor, and teaching adjunct. Only full graduate faculty members may chair doctoral committees. Full or associate graduate faculty may chair master's committees. Associate members may direct theses in an academic unit other than their own at the discretion of the graduate coordinator and/or the chair of that unit. If the chair of a student's committee leaves the University of Memphis, that person can no longer serve as chair and must be replaced by another graduate faculty member.

Affiliate or adjunct graduate faculty may be members of doctoral and master's committees in their areas of expertise, but may not serve as chair. Faculty members employed outside the University of Memphis must apply for Adjunct Graduate Faculty Status.

No more than one adjunct or affiliate graduate faculty member may serve as a voting member of a student's committee. If a student has two adjuncts or an adjunct and an affiliate member on their committee, both members can participate in the final defense meeting, but only one of the two can sign the final thesis or dissertation approval page.
Teaching adjuncts members may not serve on committees.
** 2.3 Institutional Review Board (N/A)
*** 2.3.1 Human Subjects (x)
All University of Memphis faculty, staff, or students who propose to engage in any research activity involving the use of human subjects must have prior approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is responsible for safeguarding rights and welfare of all persons participating in research projects, whether funded or non-funded.

Human subjects means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether a professional in the field or a student) conducting research obtains (1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual or (2) identifiable private information. Research means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalized knowledge.
Students who fail to comply with University policy may jeopardize the awarding of the degree they seek.

The appropriate IRB or IACUC approval form must accompany an approved Thesis/Dissertation Proposal form. In addition, a copy of the IRB or IACUC approval form and examples of informed consent forms must be submitted with your thesis or dissertation. For further information, contact the IRB coordinator in the Office of Research Support Services at (901) 678-2533.
*** 2.3.2 Vertebrate Animals (x)
All uses of vertebrate animals must receive prior approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 
*** 2.3.4 Biohazards (x)
Research involving recombinant DNA, radioisotopes, or other hazardous material must receive prior approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.
** 2.4 Use of Copyright Materials (x)
Excerpts to be reprinted from other sources, such as maps, figures, tables, or text, must meet the same paper and margin requirements for the thesis or dissertation. Students must obtain permission from the author or publisher of copyrighted materials used beyond the limits of the "Fair Use" doctrine. The general fair use practice states that quotations of a brief prose passage or several lines of verse do not require permission. However, fair use nowhere is spelled out exactly. Check the U.S.Copyright Office for further information. In any case, the student must quote accurately and credit the source. An explanation of copyright law and fair use, along with a guide to obtaining written permission from copyright owners, may be found in The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.

For doctoral dissertations, University Microfilms International (ProQuest) requires the author to sign a certificate that use of copyrighted material beyond brief excerpts has the written permission of copyright owners and that the student is responsible for any copyright violations. A copy of all letters of permission for use of copyrighted materials must be submitted along with the microfilming/copyright agreement form (given to the student AFTER the defended, corrected copy has been reviewed by the Graduate School).

Master's students may write to the Information Section, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20559 to request forms. Telephone: (202) 707-3000 or the forms may be downloaded and printed for use in registering or renewing a claim to copyright. The forms and the information may also be accessed and downloaded through the Copyright Office web site.
** 2.5 Plagiarism (x)
The term plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, the use, by paraphrase or direct quotation, of the published or unpublished work of another person without full or clear acknowledgment. It also includes the unacknowledged use of materials prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or other academic materials. Published or unpublished work might include art, graphics, computer programs, raw data, web sites, music and any other type of creative expression. The most obvious form of plagiarism is copying word-for-word without enclosing the copied work in quotation marks and without citing the original source in the text.  For University of Memphis's plagiarism policy, see this website: http://saweb.memphis.edu/judicialaffairs/
*** TODO 2.5.1 Guidelines for Avoiding Plagiarism (double check to make sure) 
Use Your Own Words and Ideas. 
Give Credit for Copied, Adapted, or Paraphrased Material. If you repeat another's *exact words*, you *MUST use quotation marks* AND cite the source. If you adapt a chart or paraphrase a sentence, you must still cite the source. *Paraphrase* means that you restate the author's ideas, meaning, and information in your own words.
*Avoid Using Others' Work with Minor Cosmetic Changes*. Examples: using "less" for "fewer", reversing the order of a sentence, changing terms in a computer code, or altering a spreadsheet layout. If the work is essentially the same, you must give credit.
There Are No Freebies. ALWAYS cite words, information, and ideas you use if they are new to you (learned in your research). No matter where you find it--even in an encyclopedia or on the Internet -- you must cite it.
*Beware of Common Knowledge. You don't have to cite "common knowledge," but the fact must be commonly known.*

Full justification of margins is *NOT* acceptable; the *right-hand margin must be jagged*. (x)
Hyphenation at the right-hand margin is allowed as long as it does not cause difficulty in reading. (x)
** TODO 3.4 Spacing (x)(might or might not work)
Double space all text. Double space between all footnote entries. Double space between all bibliography or reference entriesDouble space between all paragraphs within centered/and or subheadings. (x)

Triple space before and after all tables and figures within the text. (not sure is triple before figures) 
** 3.5 Page Numbers (x)
All page numbers should stand alone without any form of punctuation and should be 1/2" from the bottom of a page. The last line of text must be 1" from the bottom. (x)
Preliminary pages, such as the Copyright, Dedication, Acknowledgement, Abstract, Preface, Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Figures, or List of Abbreviations, etc. must be numbered in small Roman numerals beginning with "ii" and must be centered on the page. (x)
Pages in the body of text must be numbered using Arabic numerals and must be centered at the bottom of each page. (x)
*** 3.5.1 PAGINATION AND SEQUENCING TABLE (x)
** TODO 3.6 Subheadings (need extra double check) 
Chapter and section heads should be consistent throughout the entire document.  (x)
Preliminary page titles (i.e. Abstract, Table of Contents, etc.) should each be treated as chapter titles in terms of formatting. (?)
Do not begin any subheading or other divisions on separate pages.(?)

Footnotes are NOT to be numbered consecutively throughout the text. At the beginning of each new chapter, begin each footnote number with the Arabic number "1."
** TODO 3.8 Widows and Orphans (need extra double check)
A thesis or dissertation will *not be accepted* if it contains "*widows or orphans*." *Widow* lines occur when the last line of a paragraph appears alone at the top of a page. *Orphan* lines occur when the first line of a paragraph appears alone at the bottom of a page. Most word processing programs have an "Orphan and Widow Control" feature that will automatically manage this once it is activated.  Instances in which you might have to manually correct orphans and widows include:

*A subheading at the bottom of a page must have two lines of text below it*. Otherwise, the subheading and text must begin at the top of the next page.
*A new paragraph at the bottom of a page, must include two lines of text*. Otherwise, the entire paragraph should begin at the top of the next page.
*When ending a paragraph at the top of a page*, there must be at least two lines of text.
You may allow more than 1" at the bottom of a page in order to avoid widows and orphan lines.

The literature review should be a comprehensive discussion. It should provide a unique and valuable reference resource for other scholars in your field.
*** Statement of research objectives (if not explicitly stated in the introduction)
This statement should consist of specific objectives to be addressed by the research published in the thesis or dissertation.
*** Body of the work
(methods and materials, results, and discussion in scientific disciplines).
*** Overall conclusion (if not explicitly stated in the discussion).
The discussion or last chapter or section should be followed by an overall conclusion. This section should include a brief restatement of your conclusions presented in the body of the text.
*** Bibliography or References section.
The bibliography or reference section should appear in one location at the end of the thesis or dissertation BEFORE any appendices (unless specified differently in a scientific discipline) and should include ALL cited references. Citations should be *listed alphabetically* and should *conform to a single format* that is accepted as standard within your discipline. Try to *avoid breaking bibliographic entries onto a following page*. All sources that are cited in the body of the text should appear in the bibliography, and all sources that are cited in the bibliography must also be cited in text.  Separate bibliographies for each chapter are NOT acceptable, unless your manuscript consists of articles submitted or accepted for publication.
*** Appendices (if needed). 
The majority of the materials included should represent the work of the student. The format may include individual tables and/or figures with legends, text alone, or whole chapters. The same format rules that apply to the text of the thesis or dissertation must also apply to all appendices. References included in the appendices must be included in the comprehensive bibliography or reference section.
** 5.2 Using Journal Articles as Chapters or Sections (N/A)
*** In some departments, the document may include, as chapters, articles that have been published or have been submitted to journals for publication. A thesis may include one or more articles; a dissertation may include two or more.

*** The Introduction and Conclusion may be presented in the style of one of the journals in the document.
*** References will follow the style of the journal to which the article was submitted.
*** Continuous pagination is required throughout the entire manuscript.
*** When submitting your document to the Graduate School for review, include sample articles for each chapter and the journal's style guide or "Instructions to Author" to serve as a guideline for formatting references and citations.
** 5.3 Tables and Figures
*** All tables and figures, including the caption, must meet margin, font, and format requirements.
*** TODO Triple space before and after all tables and figures within the text.

*** All diagrams, drawings, and figures must be clear, sharp, and large enough to be readable.
*** Color figures, illustrations, or charts are acceptable.
*** Tables and/or figures one half page or less in length must appear on the same page with text either above or below. If a table and/or figure is larger than one half page, it should be inserted on a single page.
*** Two small tables or figures should be placed together on a single page, with a triple space between them.
*** Extra-wide tables or figures should be placed in landscape orientation (broadside). The table number and title should be closest to the 1.50" left margin AND the page number should also be placed in landscape orientation.
*** Master's students may place tables and/or figures in the body of the text or in a separate appendix UNLESS several tables and/or figures are listed together and interrupt the flow of the text, then they MUST be placed in a separate appendix.Due to the required microfilming of all doctoral dissertations, tables and figures MUST be incorporated within the text. Insert each table and/or figure as close as possible after it has been referenced in the text.
*** If tables and/or figures are placed in a separate appendix, please be sure to reference this information in the text.  For example: "Please see Table 1 in Appendix A."
** 5.4 Images (N/A)
All images (color or grayscale) included in your document must be clearly readable both onscreen and when printed.
The format embedded in the PDF version should be bitmaps, GIFs, or JPEG images.

Equations should be centered or aligned with the left-hand margin.
Equation numbers (typed in either parentheses or brackets) must be aligned with the right-hand margin.
** 5.6 Citations (x)
All theses and dissertations must use the standard citation style guide for their respective disciplines to cite their sources. Examples of these guises include, but are not limited to, APA, ASA, MLA, Chicago, and Turabian styles.  For some disciplines, the accepted style guide is one of a particular journal.  

In keeping with plagiarism guidelines, any and all ideas, words, images, etc. that come from another source MUST be cited according to a standard style guide.  Most style guides offer citation rules for the major types of source information: books, journal articles, etc.  If the style guide does not cover a particular type of source, follow the standard format for the other types of sources. Always include as much information about each source as possible so that the reader could find the source again if need be.
*** TODO 5.6.1 Citation Generators
Citation software can be a great time-saver when working on a major project, but they are not perfect.  All citations must be proofread carefully to catch any mistakes.
*** 5.6.2 Citing Electronic Sources (N/A)
Some style guides have not caught up with the technology.  For internet and electronic sources, use the following list as a guide when citing:

The author's name (if known) or screen name/alias
The full title of the document or webpage cited as a journal article
The title of the complete work (the entire website)
The name of the party responsible for the website 
Version or file numbers (if applicable or known)
The date of the document's publication or last revision (if applicable or known--the copyright date is sometimes acceptable)
The full http address (URL)--some style manuals may require you to put the address in brackets
The date you most recently accessed the materials  
* TODO 6. REVIEW PROCESS
Submit the following items to the Graduate School to begin the review process, *AFTER* you have defended and made all corrections given to you at the time of your final defense:
** *1* A *paper copy printed* on standard computer paper must be submitted.
** *2* A completed *Final Committee Approval for Electronic Thesis* or Dissertation Submission form signed by ALL committee members.
** *3* A *Thesis/Dissertation Defense form*, if one has not been previously submitted by your department.The IRB or IACUC approval form or waiver, if human or animal subjects were used for your research.
** *4* An APA or *Non-APA checklist* appropriate to your discipline. *Both the student and major professor* must check all applicable items and *sign the form*.
** *REMINDER*: The Graduate School is required to have a *Comprehensive Exam Results form* for ALL degree seeking students. If you have not been administered a separate oral and/or written comprehensive exam by your department, the oral defense of your thesis will satisfy this requirement; therefore, this form must be submitted to Graduate School by your department.
The checklists are NOT to be used as a style guide for formatting purposes. They are used to ensure that you have followed specific Graduate School requirements, in addition to what is required in your style manual or refereed journal.
If you did not use the Chicago Manual of Style, APA, ASA, ADA, MLA, or Kate Turabian manuals for formatting purposes, you must submit a sample article from the refereed journal and the journal's style guide or "Instructions to Author" to serve as a guideline for formatting references and citations.
* 7. FINAL SUBMISSION PROCESS
** 7.1 EMBEDDING DOCUMENT FONTS (N/A for Latex)
All document fonts must be embedded. Embedding fonts simply means that your font information used to create your document will always look the exact same way it does when stored in a PDF file. If your fonts are not embedded, Adobe Acrobat will substitute fonts available on a reader's computer. Any type of font substitution can result in significant differences between the original document and what the reader sees. Fonts can be embedded when you convert from Word to PDF. Embedding fonts will significantly increase your file size.  When converting Word documents to PDF, ensure that the "scale to fit" box is NOT selected as it creates problems with the document's margins.
*** 7.1.1 How to Embed Fonts Using Microsoft Word 2010 on a PC:
You will need to first visit Word Options. To get there, click the File tab > Options > Save, and make sure that "Embed fonts in the file" in the textbox is checked.
*** 7.1.2 How to Embed Fonts Using Microsoft Word 2007 on a PC:
Create your manuscript using either Times New Roman or Ariel fonts. 
Click the circular Office Button in the upper left-hand corner of Microsoft Word. A new window will open.
In the bottom right-hand corner is a button called Word Options. Click that button. 
Choose Save from the left sidebar. 
Check the box next to Embed Fonts in the file. Click the OK button. 
Save your document. 
*** 7.1.3 How to Embed Fonts in Earlier Versions of Microsoft Word:
Create your manuscript using a TrueType font.
On the Tools Menu, choose Options.
Click the Save tab.
Select the Embed TrueType Fonts check box.
Save the document.
*** 7.1.4 Using Microsoft Word on a Mac using Word 2011:
Convert your document to PDF.

Select File: Print
Click on the Preview button - a new document should be generated.
Select File: Print again (you should be in the newly-created document when you do this).
Click the PDF button, and then select "Save as PDF" from the pop-up menu.
Choose a filename and save the file; the file you just saves should have all of the fonts embedded.
*** 7.1.5 Using Microsoft Word on an Earlier Version:
Microsoft Word for Mac does not have a feature that allows for embedding fonts. Consider using OpenOffice (which embeds fonts automatically while converting to PDF) or using a PC to embed fonts in your manuscript.
** 7.2 INSTRUCTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION (N/A)
After all Graduate School corrections have been made, embed document fonts, and convert to a PDF file. Carefully review your document before submitting to the ETD site.
Do *NOT* assume that if the final Word document looks fine, the PDF will look fine. In particular, may close attention to charts, graphs, tables, equations, special accent marks, and any graphics you imported into your Word document. If something looks incorrect, re-convert your document again to PDF. There should be no difficulty including accent marks or special characters in your abstract as long as they are the basic ASCI character set (numbers 0-9, upper and lowercase letters A-Z, and typical English punctuation).
If you decide to use Adobe Acrobat Professional to convert your document instead of using Word, include bookmarks for all preliminary pages, for the first page of each new chapter, and for the first page of the bibliography or reference section and any appendices.

** TODO 7.3 Access Restrictions and Embargoes (Ask Eunseo about this)
Access to the University of Memphis Electronic Theses and Dissertations is determined by the student author and may fall into the following categories:

*** Open Access - open to anyone with Internet access.
*** Embargoed - The author has chosen to prevent online access for 3 or 5 years from the date of creation to protect their creative rights.
*** No Access - Due to patents included or other intellectual properties, the author has chosen not to make their work available online.

Eighty to 90% of publishers of professional journals (e.g., Elsevier) have decided that theses or dissertations that are made available online do not qualify as a prior publication, and therefore do not deter future publications. However, other publishers have reached the opposite conclusion.
If you have patent concerns or concerns that posting to the ETD site might prevent later acceptance of your work by professional journals or book publishers, consult with your committee and with possible future publishers to make an informed decision. Most professional journals publish "Instructions for Authors" on their website where this specific issue is addressed.
