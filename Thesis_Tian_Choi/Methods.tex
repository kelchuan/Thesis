\subsection{Method of approach}
The numerical modeling code, SNAC (\textbf{S}tGermai\textbf{N} \textbf{A}nalysis of \textbf{C}ontinua), is an explicit Lagrangian finite element code that solves the force and energy %\add[XT]{find out which one is energy balance equation}
balance equations for elasto-visco-plastic materials. Figure~\ref{fig_Methods7_3} shows major components of SNAC.

For each time step, strain and strain rates are updated based on the initial or previous velocity fields under the constraints from boundary conditions. A constitutive model returns updated stresses corresponding to these deformation measures. Internal forces are then calculated from the updated stresses, which is plugged into the momentum balance equation together with the body force term. Then, the damped
%\add[XT]{better understand the damped force}
net force divided by inertial mass yields acceleration at a node point, which is time-integrated to velocity and displacement.

A 3D domain is discretized into hexahedral elements, each of which is in turn divided into two sets of tetrahedra. This symmetric discretization prevents faulting from favoring a specific direction or ``mesh grains''. 

Rheology for the oceanic lithosphere is assumed to be elasto-visco-plastic (EVP). When viscosity is high at low temperature, the EVP rheology implemented in SNAC essentially becomes the Mohr-Coulomb plasticity with strain weakening that can create shear bands that behave like faults. Strain softening is realized by cohesion decreasing with increasing amount of permanent (i.e., plastic) strain. I assume this relationship is linear for simplicity. It is sufficient for a full description of such a linear strain weakening to define initial and final values of cohesion and a critical plastic strain at which cohesion becomes the final value. I define the rate of strain weakening as the cohesion difference divided by the critical plastic strain and use it as one of the model parameters. When temperature is high and viscosity is low, the rheology becomes the Maxwell viscoelasticity and can model creeping flow. This property of the EVP model makes it possible to set up a structure with a brittle lithosphere and a ductile asthenosphere through a proper temperature distribution. Rheological parameters are taken from previous studies that use a similar rheology [e.g., \citealp{Buck2005}; \citealp{Tucholke2008}] or from lab experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{Kirby1987}. 

For 3D diking processs, the strain $\Delta\varepsilon_{xx}$ associated with diking leads to stress changes, $\Delta\sigma_{xx}$, $\Delta\sigma_{yy}$ and $\Delta\sigma_{zz}$. These stress changes due to diking are computed according to the linear elastic constitutive equation $\sigma_{ij}=\lambda\varepsilon_{kk}\delta_{ij}+2\mu\varepsilon_{ij}$.

\subsection{Model Setup}

\end{figure}

The 3D models have a common geometry of 60 km $\times$ 20 km $\times$ 20 km in $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes respectively with a resolution ($\Delta x$) of 1 km (i.e., $\Delta x$ is the size of each hexahedron element)(Fig.~\ref{fig_Methods8_1}). %For comparison with the previous 2D models \citep[e.g.][]{Buck2005, Tucholke2008}, I \note[EC]{also run pseudo-2D models}{Are you still going to include pseudo-2D models?} and they have a geometry of (60 km $\times$ 20 km $\times$ 1 km) in $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes respectively with a resolution of $\Delta x$ = 0.5 km.
The initial temperature field linearly increases from 0 \degree C at the top surface to 240 \degree C at the depth of 6 km, reflecting enhanced cooling due to hydrothermal circulation. Below 6 km, the temperature profile follows the instantaneous cooling of a semi-infinite half-space model of moving plates \citep[e.g.,][]{Turcotte2002}. Two sides perpendicular to the $z$ coordinate axis are free-slip. Hydrostatic sea water pressure is added on top of the seafloor. The heights of the water columns are locally determined as (4000 - $h(x,z)$) m, where $h(x,z)$ is the topography at a location, $(x,z)$. The bottom surface is supported by the Winkler foundation following \citet{Buck2005}. Temperature is fixed at 0 \degree C on the top surface and at 1300 \degree C on the bottom surface. 

Diking, represented by the factor M as described above, is assumed to occur in the middle of the doamin (Fig.~\ref{fig_Methods8_1}), where the lithosphere is the thinnest.

We adopt the linear isotropic elasticity, power-law viscosity of dry diabase \citep[e.g.,][]{Kirby1987, Buck2005} and the Mohr-Coulomb plastic model. The complete list of model parameters are given in Table~\hyperref[Tab_ModelParameters]{\ref{Tab_ModelParameters}}.

%\subsection{Parameters to control}
Before running 3D models, I have run hundreds of psedudo-2D models for initial setup and benchmarking with previous studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Buck2005, Tucholke2008}. Preliminary pseudo-2D results show that the model behavior in faulting pattern is sensitive to the rate of strain weakening. Two cases of strain weakening are tested in the 3D models. In one case (denoted as Type 1 weakening), cohesion linearly decreases from 44 MPa (denoted as $C_{i}$) to 4 MPa ($C_{e}$) for plastic strain accumulating from 0 ($\varepsilon_{p_{i}}^{1}$) to 0.1 ($\varepsilon_{p_{e}}^{1}$). It has a characteristic fault slip of 150 m for pseudo-2D models and 300 m for 3D models. The other case (Type 2 weakening) assumes cohesion linearly decreasing from 44 MPa ($C_{i}$) to 4 MPa ($C_{e}$) for plastic strain accumulating from 0 ($\varepsilon_{p_{i}}^{2}$) to 0.33 ($\varepsilon_{p_{e}}^{2}$). In this case, the characteristic fault slip for pseudo-2D models is 500 m and for 3D models is 1 km. The characteristic fault slip is defined as $\Delta X_{c}$=3$\Delta x \varepsilon_{p_{e}}$ where 3 $\Delta x$ represents the thickness of the shear bands which is usually 2 to 4 times $\Delta x$ (size of a hexahedron element) \citep{Lavier2000}. When $\Delta X_{c}$ amount of slip takes place at the fault interface, the cohesion of the material at the faulting interface decreases to $C_{e}$. In this way, under the same amount of $\Delta X_{c}$, models with different resolution should produce the same faulting patterns. 

Although how to estimate the M values from observations is a subject of on-going research, constraints are available from a large dataset of bathymetry, gravity and seismic surveys as well as geological drilling. Generally, at slow spreading ridges, magma supplies mostly at the center of the ridge segment and decreases towards the tip of the segment \citep[e.g.,][]{Tolstoy1993,Chen1999,Carbotte2015}. There is also evidence for shorter wavelength of 10 to 20 km discrete focus of magma accretion along the ridge axis \citep{Lin1990}.

The numerical cost of a 3D model is non-trivial. For 2 Myr of model time, each model usually runs on 192 cores for about 48 hours (i.e., around 10$^{4}$ core-hours). %\add[EC]{Add some more details about the hardware you used. CPU maker, model, clock speed. Also, information about networking hardwar of the cluster, since it's relevant to the numerical cost.} %\add[XT]{use 96 cores can improve the efficiency a little bit (Longer time but smaller amount of SUs needed).})

Based on these observational constraints and computational cost, I start considering a few scenarios of variations in M along the ridge axis. They are 1) three types of functional forms, linear, sinusoidal and square root; 2) three ranges of M variation along the ridge axis, 0.5 to 0.7, 0.5 to 0.8 and 0.2 to 0.8; and 3) two types of weakening rate, type 1 and type 2.
% \note[EC]{I think I suggested to use more explicit names like fast and slow but looks like you decided to stick to type 1 and 2.}.

While 18 models are possible, I could run 15 models with the available computational resources. 
%with M varying along the ridge-axis and 1 model with constant M = 0.8. 
The complete list of the models is given in Table~\hyperref[Tab1_1]{\ref{Tab1_1}}.
