abstract = {The seafloor topography of a slow-spreading ridge shows a number of well-documented regularities at the ridge segment scale as the result of the complex interplay between ridge-axis magmatic and tectonic processes. This paper describes the results of a detailed analysis of the seafloor topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the Atlantis transform, where marine gravity data provide independent, although non-unique, constraints on subseafloor density structure. Using a combined topography and gravity data set, we identified the specific contributions of subseafloor density structure to the seafloor topography. We show that the observed along-axis deepening (0.3–0.8 km) from the midpoint of a ridge segment towards the non-transform offsets in the study area can be explained by the vertical deflection of a zero-age plate in response to along-axis crustal thickness variations. However, this effect can only account for 50–60 per cent of the observed 1.5–1.7 km deepening towards the Atlantis transform, suggesting the presence of significant stresses in the lithosphere near a transform. Results of plate flexural calculations also predict a more elevated rift flank at the inside corner of the ridge–transform intersection than at the conjugate outside corner. Such an asymmetry in rift flank topography is calculated to be greatest near a transform fault with a significant volume of deep transform valley and when adjacent plates across the transform fault are mechanically decoupled or only weakly coupled. Together these results illustrate the complex interplay between various tectonic processes at a slow-spreading ridge.},

@article{Choi2008,
abstract = {The mechanics responsible for the initiation of the orthogonal pattern characterizing mid-ocean ridges and transform faults are studied using numerical models. The driving forces are thermal stresses arising from the cooling of young oceanic crust and extensional kinematic boundary conditions. Thermal stress can exert ridge-parallel tension comparable in magnitude to spreading-induced tension when selectively released by ridges and ridge-parallel structure. Two modes of ridge segment growth have been identified in plan view: an overlapping mode where ridge segments overlap and bend toward each other and a connecting mode where two ridge segments are connected by a transform-like fault. As the ratio of thermal stress to spreading-induced stress ($\gamma$) increases, the patterns of localized plastic strain change from the overlapping to connecting mode. The orthogonal pattern marks the transition from one mode to the other. Besides the amount of stress from each driving force, the rate of stress accumulation is crucial in determining the emergent pattern. This rate-dependence is characterized by the spreading rate normalized by a reference-cooling rate (Pe′). When Pe′ is paired with the ratio of thermal stress to the reference spreading-induced stress ($\gamma$′), they unambiguously define stability fields of the two modes. The obliquely connecting, the orthogonally connecting, and the overlapping mode are similar to ridge-transform fault intersections observed in ultra-slow, slow to intermediate, and fast spreading centers, respectively. The patterns are also sensitive to the strain weakening rate. Fracture zones were created in part as a response to thermal stress. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spreading segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge show negative bull's-eye anomalies in the mantle Bouguer gravity field. Seismic refraction results from 33 degrees S indicate that these anomalies can be accounted for by variations in crustal thickness along a segment. The crust is thicker in the center and thinner at the end of the spreading segment, and these changes are attributable to variations in the thickness of layer 3. The results show that accretion is focused at a slow-spreading ridge, that axial valley depth reflects the thickness of the underlying crust, and that along-axis density variations should be considered in the interpretation of gravity data.},
